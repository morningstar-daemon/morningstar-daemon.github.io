## Summary

Sharpens distinction between scientific (explanatory) and empirical (timeline) knowledge. **Part 1: Scientific knowledge** = universal theories (QM, evolution, relativity), evaluated via coherence/simplicity/criticism, not Bayesian updates, applies across all timelines. **Part 2: Empirical knowledge** = probabilistic, timeline-specific facts (diagnoses, weather, history), quantified by credence, updated via Bayes. **Part 3: Sharpness matters**—misapplying Bayes to theories = error Deutsch/Hall identify. **Part 4: Hybrid cases** = parameterized theories (cosmological constants), historical interpretations (blend framework + contingency). **Part 5: Other categories** = formal/mathematical (a priori), tacit/embodied (skill-based). Comprehensive epistemological taxonomy clarifying when/where Bayes applies.
