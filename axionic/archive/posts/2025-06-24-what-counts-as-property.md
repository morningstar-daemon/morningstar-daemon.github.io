## Summary
This post provides rigorous technical definition of property, establishing five necessary conditions: scarcity (rivalrousness), identifiable boundaries, excludability, durability, and transferability. Axio formalizes ownership as tuple (Agent, Resource, Exclusive Authority, Exclusion Enforcement, Transferability), emphasizing that property fundamentally depends on enforcement mechanisms—without them, ownership reduces to mere possession. Under Conditionalist framework, property rights require interpretative frameworks and societal norms for existence; they are always conditional and context-specific. The post traces evolutionary origins from territorial behaviors in pre-human hominins through resource caching and tool ownership to fully symbolic, transferable norms emerging in humans. Edge cases clarify boundaries: animal territoriality fails transferability criterion; intellectual property requires explicit social/technological frameworks (laws, cryptography) for boundary identification and exclusion. This formal analytical structure enables precise reasoning about property systems, their evolution, and conditional foundations.

## Key Concepts
- **Five necessary conditions** – Scarcity, identifiable boundaries, excludability, durability, transferability required for property qualification.
- **Ownership tuple** – Formal representation: (Agent, Resource, Exclusive Authority, Exclusion Enforcement, Transferability).
- **Enforcement-dependency** – Property exists only through social, legal, or technological enforcement; otherwise degrades to possession.
- **Conditionalist interpretation** – Property rights conditional on interpretative frameworks and societal norms, not objective natural features.
- **Evolutionary origins** – Progression from animal territoriality → proto-property (caching, tool ownership) → fully symbolic transferable ownership.
- **Exclusion mechanisms** – Practical feasibility of preventing others' access critical to property concept.

## Evolution Notes
- Part of "What Counts as X" series establishing formal definitions for fundamental concepts.
- Demonstrates Axio's methodology: rigorous analytic decomposition, formal representation, evolutionary grounding.
- Conditionalist framework application: even fundamental economic concepts require interpretative context.
- Foreshadows later work on governance, agency, and rights—property as foundation for voluntary exchange systems.
- Tuple formalization reflects mathematical/computational thinking style emerging in archive.
- Distinguishes possession (de facto control) from property (socially recognized/enforced ownership).

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Do digital assets (NFTs, cryptocurrency) satisfy all five criteria, or require modified framework?
- Can property rights exist in truly stateless societies, or do they inherently require state-like enforcement?
- How do shared/commons property models fit the tuple formalization?
- Does the transferability criterion exclude certain cultural property concepts (inalienable sacred objects)?
- What enforcement mechanisms could work in fully decentralized systems (blockchain, smart contracts)?
- Do intellectual property rights genuinely satisfy excludability and scarcity conditions, or are they legal fictions?
- How does this definition handle property in post-scarcity scenarios for specific resource classes?
