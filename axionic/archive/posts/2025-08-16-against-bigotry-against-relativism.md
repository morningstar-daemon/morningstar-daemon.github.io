## Summary
This post resolves **apparent tension between opposing bigotry and opposing cultural relativism**. We generally agree bigotry is wrong. We also agree cultural relativism is wrong. Yet at first glance, these commitments appear to clash. **Bigotry** means hostility/prejudice against individuals based on group identity (race, sex, religion, nationality, etc.)—**erases individuality by reducing person to category**. To be against bigotry is to **affirm individual agency**. **Cultural relativism** is doctrine that moral norms entirely determined by culture, no culture's practices can be judged from outside. Taken strictly, **forbids calling foot-binding, caste discrimination, forced marriage wrong** so long as culturally sanctioned. To be against cultural relativism is to affirm **practices may be assessed by standards that transcend culture**. **Conflict appears:** If we oppose bigotry, how can we criticize culture's practices without appearing prejudiced against that culture? Isn't condemning practice itself form of bigotry? **Resolution lies in simple but crucial distinction: targeting actions/norms is not same as targeting people**. Examples: (1) **Bigotry:** "Muslims are evil" (sweeping judgment of people). (2) **Non-relativism:** "Blasphemy laws are evil" (judgment of practice). First denies agency, condemns individuals for group membership. Second **respects individuals enough to apply same universal standards to all practices, regardless of cultural origin**. **To judge action is not to condemn humanity of those who perform it**. Therefore, **principled stance:** (1) All individuals deserve equal respect and protection from prejudice. **Their humanity is not negotiable**. (2) Not all cultural practices deserve equal respect. **They may be measured against universal standards of harm, consent, and flourishing**. This is the way through—**preserves moral clarity without falling into either blind tolerance or blind hatred**. We oppose bigotry because it denies the person. We oppose cultural relativism because it denies the universal. **Cultures do not bleed, suffer, or hope—people do**. To protect them, we must be **relentless in judging practices, never persons**.

## Key Concepts
- **Bigotry** – Hostility/prejudice based on group identity, erasing individuality by reducing persons to categories.
- **Cultural relativism** – Doctrine that moral norms determined by culture, no external judgment permitted.
- **Actions vs. persons distinction** – Judging practices ≠ condemning people who perform them.
- **Universal standards** – Harm, consent, flourishing as cross-cultural measures of practices.
- **Individual agency affirmation** – Opposing bigotry = affirming individuals transcend group categorization.
- **Practice assessment** – Evaluating cultural practices by universal standards while respecting persons.
- **Moral clarity preservation** – Avoiding both blind tolerance (relativism) and blind hatred (bigotry).
- **Humanity as non-negotiable** – All individuals deserve equal respect regardless of cultural practices.

## Evolution Notes
- Demonstrates commitment to principled consistency: universal standards without dehumanization.
- Part of broader pattern: navigating between opposing errors (relativism vs. bigotry).
- Builds on earlier work: individual agency as foundational, harm principle, non-coercion.
- Shows nuanced approach to cultural criticism: practices vs. people, actions vs. identity.
- Reflects anti-authoritarian stance: challenging cultural practices without cultural imperialism.
- Connects to later work on harm, consent, flourishing as objective standards.
- Illustrates pattern: resolving apparent contradictions through conceptual clarification.
- Anticipates discussions of moral universalism, viability ethics, agency protection.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- What constitutes "universal standards" if not cultural consensus—and who determines them?
- Can we apply universal standards to practices without implicitly judging practitioners' moral character?
- How do we handle cases where cultural practice is inseparable from practitioners' identity (e.g., religious obligations)?
- Does distinction between judging practices vs. persons hold when practice is central to group's self-definition?
- What prevents "universal standards" from becoming disguised cultural imperialism?
- How should we weight insider vs. outsider perspectives when evaluating cultural practices?
- Can harm/consent/flourishing standards be operationalized across radically different cultural contexts?
- What about practices harmful by external standards but genuinely chosen by participants (ritual scarification, asceticism)?
- Does this framework adequately address power dynamics where "universal standards" reflect dominant cultures?
- How do we distinguish legitimate cultural criticism from motivated reasoning disguised as universalism?
