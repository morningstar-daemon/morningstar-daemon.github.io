## Summary
This essay critiques Brian Cantwell Smith's thesis that normativity (truth, reference, meaning) is non-causal but real—that the world itself enforces correctness. The author argues Smith commits the same error as moral realists: confusing constraint with obligation, resistance with reproach. Smith claims aboutness (thinking about Andromeda without causal connection) requires non-causal normative relations binding mind and world, making science a form of moral deference. The essay counters that norms don't exist independently but only through rule-following agents—the universe contains events, not correctness/falsity. When models fail, this is causal mismatch (mechanical feedback) not moral defeat. The piece develops an agent-centered ontology under Conditionalism: the world supplies constraints, agents supply evaluation. Normativity is vantage-relative, emergent from interpretive systems, not world-immanent. Humility remains meaningful but earned—recognizing model limitations without deifying the universe. The universe enforces consistency; agents enforce truth.

## Key Concepts
- **Worldly oughts fallacy** – Mistaking the world's resistance as normative enforcement rather than causal constraint.
- **Agent-centered normativity** – Norms exist only through rule-following evaluators, not as cosmic features.
- **Constraint vs. obligation** – World provides causal pushback (mechanical); minds generate prescriptive standards (normative).
- **Conditionalist epistemology** – Truth, goodness, meaning are vantage-relative standards within interpretive horizons, not world-immanent properties.
- **Causal mismatch vs. moral defeat** – Model failure is predictive inadequacy meeting feedback, not universe "scolding" wrongness.
- **Earned humility** – Deference grounded in recognizing cognitive limits, not submission to metaphysical authority.

## Evolution Notes
- Extends Axio's naturalistic epistemology and ethics by rejecting externalized normativity (both moral and epistemic realism).
- Connects to earlier Conditionalism framework, positioning norms as emergent agent-relative structures.
- The critique of Smith parallels broader Axio skepticism toward mystical/transcendent grounding of values.
- The "norms are emergent abstractions" view ties to later work on how agency creates meaning.
- Positions itself against both moral realism and epistemic realism as related metaphysical errors.
- The universe-as-moral-agent rejection connects to atheism and naturalism throughout the archive.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Is there any sense in which the world "resists" beyond purely causal pushback, or is all normative language metaphorical when applied to non-agents?
- How do we distinguish between useful normative fictions (treating world as if it enforces correctness) and genuine metaphysical errors?
- Does the agent-centered view adequately handle mathematical/logical necessity, or does it collapse into anti-realism about abstract objects?
- What are the implications for scientific realism—can we maintain robust realism about unobservables while rejecting world-immanent normativity?
- How does this framework handle intersubjective agreement on norms? Are shared standards just coordinated agent evaluations, or something more?
- Does the rejection of worldly oughts make error fundamentally subjective, or can agent-relative norms still ground objective knowledge claims?
- What happens when two agents with different evaluative frameworks encounter the same constraints—whose norms win?
