## Summary
Order emerges from distinctions. Chaos = undifferentiated homogeneity. Patterns arise through contrasts (boundaries, differences). Information theory: distinctions carry information. Core insight: Differentiation precedes structure; order is relational (defined by what things are NOT); pure homogeneity contains no information.
