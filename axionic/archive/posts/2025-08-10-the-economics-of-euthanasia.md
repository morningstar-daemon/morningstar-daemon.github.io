## Summary
This post examines **Canada's MAID (Medical Assistance in Dying) program** as proving ground for state-sanctioned autonomy boundaries. Began as carefully hedged exception for terminal suffering; now expanded to cases far from imminent death, will extend to mental illness alone unless halted. **Core principle clear: you own your life, may end it on your terms.** Problem: machinery delivering choice riddled with **incentives making killing easier than caring**. Not paranoia but basic incentive theory—if death cheaper/faster/more convenient than life, system will lean toward death over time without conscious push; bureaucratic logic does the work. To make MAID genuinely about autonomy rather than convenience, **rewire incentives until every actor's self-interest aligns with preserving real choice**. **Ten-point incentive redesign framework:** (1) **Erase budgetary signal**—no hospital/ministry sees financial benefit from MAID case; budgets calculated as if patient continued care at average cost; outlier MAID rates trigger audit. (2) **Pay for life-preserving interventions**—MAID has billing code but suffering-relief work often doesn't (perverse); pay clinicians equally/better for palliative care optimization, aggressive pain interventions, social/logistical support coordination, values-clarification counseling; "Relief-First Episode" code: 2-6 weeks funded support before Track 2 eligibility finalized. (3) **Guarantee the alternatives**—when suffering driven by solvable problems (housing insecurity, inadequate home care, lack of adaptive equipment), address first; **Counterfactual Care Guarantee**: statutory right to necessary interventions within 14-30 days, funded from pool separate from hospital budgets. (4) **Two keys to gate**—Track 2 requires Independent Patient Advocate (unaffiliated with treating institution) attesting alternatives offered/available, patient understands prognosis, decision stable over time; complex cases: adversarial case conference (one clinician argues for, one against, both file written reasons). (5) **End soft coercion**—no clinician "pitches" MAID; can answer questions but can't initiate suggestion except in rare situations; provide standardized, literacy-tested decision aids presenting survival-compatible options before MAID. (6) **Specialist capacity checks**—capacity assessment by specialist in relevant field (psychiatry for mental illness, neurology for neurodegeneration, palliative for symptom-driven); two concordant consents ≥30 days apart + same-day re-consent; if viable intervention with 20-30% chance of materially reducing suffering within 90 days exists, must be offered/scheduled before MAID. (7) **Metrics that matter**—publish monthly risk-adjusted dashboards: primary reasons for requests (medical vs. social), withdrawal rates after support arrives, time-to-support, case concentration by provider/site, disparities by disability/income/geography/Indigenous identity, survivorship outcomes 6-12 months post-decline. (8) **Audit/accountability**—randomized chart audits, license conditions for procedural failures, video-recorded consent (unless refused), independent whistleblower channel. (9) **Calibrate liability**—safe harbor for clinicians following protocol precisely; punish those bypassing (concealing alternatives, skipping capacity checks) as abusers of authority. (10) **Expansion only with reversibility**—mental illness expansion must carry sunset clause, hard performance metrics; pilot first, monitor independently, retract automatically if safeguards fail. Verdict: Not about being "for" or "against" MAID—about **understanding every moral principle gets mediated through human institutions, institutions follow incentives like water follows gravity**. If cheapest/easiest path toward death, that's path you get regardless of compassion rhetoric. Answer not ban MAID nor trust system's good intentions but **weaponize incentive design so thoroughly that killing becomes harder than caring**, only deaths passing through are those even hostile advocate couldn't in good conscience block. **Engineering morality into the machine**.

## Key Concepts
- **Incentive alignment** – System design where actors' self-interest aligns with desired moral outcomes (preserving real choice).
- **Bureaucratic logic drift** – Institutions following cost/convenience gradients toward outcomes regardless of stated values.
- **Counterfactual Care Guarantee** – Statutory right to necessary suffering-relief interventions before death becomes option.
- **Relief-First Episode** – Funded period of intensive support before eligibility for assisted death finalized.
- **Independent Patient Advocate** – Unaffiliated party verifying alternatives offered, decision informed/stable.
- **Adversarial case conference** – Structured debate with one clinician arguing for, one against MAID eligibility.
- **Soft coercion** – Subtle systemic pressure created when death presented as option without equal investment in life-preserving alternatives.
- **Engineering morality into the machine** – Designing institutional incentives to embody ethical principles mechanically.

## Evolution Notes
- Applies economic/systems thinking to bioethics—incentives as primary mechanism of moral outcomes.
- Demonstrates sophisticated policy design thinking: identifying failure modes and mechanistic solutions.
- Part of broader critique of trusting institutions' stated values over structural incentives.
- Reflects libertarian concern: autonomy requires real alternatives, not just formal legal permission.
- Connects to later work on agency protection, coercion detection, viability ethics.
- Shows engineering mindset applied to moral systems: measure, audit, adjust feedback loops.
- Anticipates axionic alignment themes: structural constraints over value declarations.
- Illustrates non-naive approach to autonomy—freedom requires material conditions and incentive structures supporting it.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can incentive alignment ever fully eliminate institutional drift toward cheaper/easier outcomes?
- What happens when "hostile advocate" standard becomes adversarial theater rather than genuine check?
- How do we measure "stable decision over time" without paternalistic indefinite delay?
- Does guaranteed alternative care create its own perverse incentive (requesting MAID to access resources)?
- Can bureaucratic systems really be engineered to preserve nuanced moral distinctions at scale?
- What if patient genuinely prefers death even when all material suffering relieved—is that autonomous or pathological?
- How do specialist capacity assessments avoid bias toward their field's interventions?
- Does publishing metrics create gaming incentives (avoiding high-risk patients to maintain low MAID rates)?
- If expansion sunset clauses become political footballs, does that undermine policy stability?
- Is the "killing harder than caring" framing itself a form of soft coercion against those rationally choosing death?
