## Summary

Critiques James Lindsay's "Woke Left vs Woke Right" syllogisms as **shared category error: conflating moral equality with empirical sameness of outcome**. Both caricatures wrongly equate equal rights/worth with equal results. **Real debate:** Does inequality of results indicate systemic injustice (progressives) or natural consequence of diverse talents/choices (conservatives)? **Correct framing:** Equal dignity under law is compatible with unequal outcomes. Question is whether disparities arise from **freedom versus coercion/structural exclusion**.

## Key Concepts
- **Moral vs empirical equality** – Conflating normative status with descriptive outcomes
- **Caricature syllogisms** – Both Left/Right strawmen commit same error
- **Fair rules of the game** – Central question: Were outcomes produced under just conditions?
- **Equal dignity + unequal outcomes** – Expected equilibrium in free societies
