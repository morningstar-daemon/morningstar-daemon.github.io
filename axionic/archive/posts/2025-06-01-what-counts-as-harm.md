## Summary

**Rigorous definition filters moral inflation.** Used without precision → confusion. **Definition**: Harm = non-consensual degradation of agent's capacity to pursue or maintain valued goals. **Key components**: (1) **Agent** (capable of valuing, choosing, acting—no agent, no harm). (2) **Valued goals** (identifiable goals agent cares about—harm degrades capacity to pursue, not mere chance of success). (3) **Capacity degradation** (ability to act effectively impaired—physically, cognitively, socially, structurally). (4) **Non-consensual** (if agent knowingly accepted risk/outcome—surgery, contact sports—not harm). **Examples that count**: Physical assault, gaslighting (undermines cognitive trust), public humiliation with consequences, destruction of critical property (tools, work), discrimination blocking opportunities. **Examples that DON'T count**: Feeling offended (no functional capacity degraded), romantic rejection (disappointment ≠ impairment), someone else's success causing envy (no obstruction), disagreement (goals untouched), unreciprocated investment (no capacity degraded). **Why works**: Captures physical/psychological/social/structural harms. Excludes symbolic/ideological/narcissistic distress. Grounds harm in agency and functional impairment. Cleanly separates harm (factual impact) from injustice (normative judgment). **Can be harmed by nature, chance, or agent—but not all harms are wrong.** To evaluate wrongness, first identify what harm is and isn't. Definition provides precision and generality—clean foundation for responsibility, rights, justice discussions without smuggling moral assumptions.
