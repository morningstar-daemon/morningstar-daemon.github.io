## Summary
This comprehensive stress test examines whether the principle "coercion is justified only if pre-consented, defensive, or compensatory" withstands 25 hard cases. Each includes mechanism, verdict, and pressure point. Cases range from blackmail (illegitimate: no consent, not defensive/compensatory, raises threat/offer distinction) to whistleblowing (legitimate if remedy-oriented, illegitimate if rent-seeking) to platform bans (justified with clear consent and exit, dubious with monopoly power). Government taxation is dubious except when narrowly defensive/compensatory; territorial monopolies weaken consent. Quarantine is justified defensive coercion if proportional and evidence-based. Civil contempt orders are justified when tied to obligations with due process. Plea bargains are often illegitimate due to asymmetry and charge-stacking leverage. Non-compete agreements are presumptively illegitimate unless narrow, time-bounded, and compensated. Union strikes are not coercion unless paired with harm threats. Consumer boycotts/social ostracism aren't coercion unless harm threats added. Doxxing is coercive if foreseeable harm is likely. Hostage-taking and ransomware are clear illegitimate coercion. Parental discipline isn't coercion when welfare-bounded. Service denial rules aren't coercion if alternatives exist. Mandatory arbitration clauses are dubious with nominal consent. Algorithmic shadow bans are coercive if leveraged for compliance. Economic sanctions are often illegitimate collective punishment unless narrowly targeted. Contracts under duress are illegitimate. Deterrence threats are justified defensive coercion if proportional. AI shutdown threats are defensive if AI is tool, murky if agent. Religious excommunication isn't coercion unless harm threats added. Police "command presence" is coercion justified only for immediate safety. Civil asset forfeiture is illegitimate absent due process. Forced rehabilitation for dissent is illegitimate coercion highlighting paternalistic domination dangers. Cross-cutting refinements: threat vs. offer (coercion when refusal leaves target worse off than status quo), expanded harms (economic, reputational, informational count when leveraged), credibility/foreseeability (threat is credible if foreseeable harm likely), consent quality (must be informed, voluntary, with meaningful alternatives), proportionality/minimality (justified coercion must be narrow, time-bounded, minimal), monopoly/essential services (heightened legitimacy standards), duress/asymmetry (consent under duress or extreme imbalance invalid), guardian/child carve-out (governance permissible if welfare-bounded and proportionate). Four-step decision test provided: (1) conditional proposal making non-compliance worse? (2) threatened harm credible/foreseeable? (3) meets justification criteria? (4) safeguards satisfied? The stress test shows original thesis broadly sound but needing refinements. With additions, principle remains coherent: coercion is justified only when it preserves or restores agency, never when it dominates.

## Key Concepts
- **Three Justifications** – Coercion legitimate only if pre-consented, defensive, or compensatory.
- **Threat vs. Offer** – Coercion occurs when refusal leaves target worse off than status quo baseline.
- **Expanded Harms** – Economic, reputational, informational harms count when leveraged for compliance.
- **Credibility Criterion** – Threat must be credible; foreseeability determines credibility.
- **Consent Quality** – Must be informed, voluntary, with meaningful alternatives; nominal consent insufficient.
- **Proportionality/Minimality** – Justified coercion must be narrow, time-bounded, minimal.
- **Monopoly Standard** – Essential services/monopolies face heightened legitimacy requirements.
- **Duress Invalidation** – Consent under duress or extreme power imbalance is invalid.
- **Guardian Carve-Out** – Parental governance permissible if welfare-bounded and proportionate.
- **Safeguards Required** – Proportionality, due process, time-boundedness, accountability must all apply.
- **Agency Preservation** – Coercion justified when preserving/restoring agency, never when dominating.
- **Decision Test** – Four-step algorithm for determining coercion legitimacy.

## Evolution Notes
- Culminates series on coercion, violence, and force distinctions.
- Demonstrates systematic application of principles to diverse cases.
- Important for understanding Axio's nuanced libertarian ethics—not absolute non-coercion.
- Provides framework applicable to AI alignment: when can systems legitimately coerce?
- Shows philosophical rigor—testing principles against hard cases rather than asserting dogma.
- Relevant to legal philosophy, political theory, and ethics of force.
- Builds on earlier posts about agency protection, rights, and defensive coercion.
- Demonstrates evolution from simple principles to sophisticated applied framework.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- How do we operationalize "meaningful alternatives" for consent validity in practice?
- What threshold of foreseeability makes a harm credible enough to constitute coercion?
- Can this framework handle collective action problems where individual consent is impossible?
- How do we apply the guardian carve-out to AI systems "parenting" users?
- What happens when defensive and compensatory justifications conflict?
- How does this framework interact with emergencies where normal safeguards break down?
- Can AI systems implement the four-step decision test reliably, or does it require human judgment?
- What role should prediction markets play in determining "foreseeability" of harms?
