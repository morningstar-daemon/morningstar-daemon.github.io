# The Viability Criterion

**Date:** December 1, 2025  
**Batch:** Batch 05 (Posts 101–125)

## Summary
This post serves as the executive summary and conceptual gateway to the Value Sequence, reframing Axio's treatment of value not as moral philosophy but as viability analysis. It describes how preference architectures behave under recursive, thermodynamic, and informational constraints—which values remain stable over time and which collapse under their own consequences. The piece explicitly rejects both objective morality and relativism, instead modeling values as control-theoretic structures subject to selection pressure. Phosphorism emerges not as a moral obligation but as a long-run attractor for agents seeking persistent agency.

## Key Concepts
- **Viability criterion** – Assessing value systems by their structural stability under selection pressure rather than moral rightness.
- **Conditional coherence** – Every "ought" depends on prior assumptions; there are no unconditional moral foundations, only conditional consistency.
- **Value collapse mechanisms** – How certain preference architectures (coercion, deception, exploitation) degrade their own conditions for persistence through recursion.
- **Phosphorism as attractor** – Values emphasizing complexity, intelligence, and coherence persist not from moral decree but from control-system dynamics.
- **Agency preservation** – The measure of value viability: maintaining functional capacity to model, choose, and steer across time.

## Evolution Notes
- Provides meta-framework for understanding Axio's entire approach to value as engineering rather than ethics.
- Explicitly distinguishes Axio from both moral realism ("objective value exists") and relativism ("anything goes").
- Frames traditional vices as predictive limitations rather than moral failings—control-theoretic analysis, not condemnation.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can a value system achieve long-run stability without converging on something resembling Phosphorism's core commitments?
- How do we distinguish between values that collapse due to structural incoherence vs. those that persist despite appearing paradoxical?
- What empirical indicators would falsify Axio's viability predictions about specific preference architectures?
