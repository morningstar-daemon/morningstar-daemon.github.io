# [From Sovereignty to Slavery](https://axionic.org/posts/164678345.from-sovereignty-to-slavery.html)

**Date:** 2025-05-28  

## Summary

Provocative thesis: **Taxation and slavery differ in degree, not kind**—both lie on continuous Taxation-Enslavement Spectrum. **Spectrum:** 0% = total self-sovereignty (no coercion), 100% = absolute enslavement (complete labor appropriation). **Historical/modern examples:** 0-20% (British monarchs, 19th-c USA, Singapore, Hong Kong), 30-50% (Canada, Israel, Japan, Switzerland), 50-70% (medieval peasants, Nordic states, France), 70-90% (Tsarist Russia, USSR, Nazi Germany), 90-100% (chattel slavery). **Insights:** (1) Coercion universal (all societies on spectrum), (2) Forces ethical re-evaluation (if slavery wrong, where's threshold?), (3) Historical blind spots (normalized practices later condemned). **Responds to critiques:** "Democratic = voluntary"—no genuine opt-out = coercion. "High taxes = benefits"—benefits don't erase coercion ethics. **Future perspective:** May future generations condemn current taxation like we condemn serfdom? Reinforces Conditionalism (justify authority explicitly). Cites Huemer, Friedman, Hayek.
