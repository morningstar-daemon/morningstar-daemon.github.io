## Summary

Critiques "decolonizing engineering" curriculum for replacing epistemic rigor with cultural relativism. Defends engineering as universal method grounded in predictive success, not cultural artifact.

**Key Concepts:**

**What Engineering Actually Is:**
- Method for generating reliable predictions about physical systems
- Authority from one criterion: model predicts or fails
- Epistemic backbone enables cross-cultural scaling
- Culturally agnostic because anchored in reality's invariances
- Newton's laws, Kirchhoff's laws, Navier-Stokes, thermodynamics don't depend on worldview

**The Category Error:**
- **Verification vs Meaning:** Engineering evaluates by correspondence to outcomes; Indigenous knowledge evaluates by cultural/relational meaning
- Both matter but answer different questions
- Significance ≠ behavior
- Curriculum collapsing domains deprives engineering of essential evaluative framework

**Critique of Course (Paul Raymond-Robichaud's tweet):**
- Places engineering and Indigenous knowledge on same epistemic plane
- Assessment: reflective writing, discussions, rituals—no modeling, design, analysis, testing
- **Skill displacement:** Replacing design competencies with introspection and narrative
- Reflection meaningful in ethics, cannot substitute for reliable design capability

**Agency in Axio Framework:**
Agency = construct, evaluate, choose among models shaping interaction with reality. Engineering amplifies agency through predictive power. But:
- Agency depends on epistemic clarity: test assumptions, reject unfounded narratives, privilege models that work
- Prescribing interpretive frames constrains agency instead of expanding it
- Worldview relativism = epistemic enclosure, not empowerment

**Respect Without Relativism:**
Can value Indigenous perspectives without flattening epistemic distinctions:
- Learn from culture without substituting epistemic foundations
- Respect cultural knowledge doesn't require treating empirical success as culturally contingent
- Doesn't require adopting rituals/beliefs as professional training

**Coherent Integration Would:**
- Teach history of engineering impacts on Indigenous communities
- Analyze cases where disregarding Indigenous knowledge caused damage
- Incorporate ecological insights with predictive value
- Embed consultation and consent processes
- **Ground in:** historical relevance, empirical clarity, technical rigor

**Central Warning:** When truth becomes negotiable, safety becomes negotiable. Predictive rigor replaced by narrative alignment = discipline loses indispensability.

## Notes

- Published November 21 (same day as Agency Criterion)
- Highly controversial position on decolonization efforts
- Defends universalism against cultural relativism in STEM
- Applies agency framework to pedagogy
- Balances respect for Indigenous perspectives with defense of engineering method
- Demonstrates willingness to take unpopular positions on politicized topics
- Part of pattern: defending epistemic standards against ideological drift
