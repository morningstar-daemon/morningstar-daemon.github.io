# [The Myth of Objective Value](https://axionic.org/posts/164846085.the-myth-of-objective-value.html)

**Date:** 2025-05-31  

## Summary

**Core thesis: All value is subjective.** Value does not exist independently—it arises only relative to agents capable of wanting, choosing, sacrificing. **Definition**: An object has value only if someone would trade for it or sacrifice to obtain it. Without valuer, value is incoherent. **Implications**: (1) "Intrinsic value" claims (rainforests, art, mathematical truths) are category errors—reverence is located in agents, not artifacts. (2) "Public goods" myth presupposes value without valuation—impossible standard. (3) Free rider problems = coordination issues, not evidence of objective value. **Philosophical alignment**: Decision theory, praxeology, evolutionary psychology (value emerges from behavior, not imposed externally). **Reframing questions**: Not "What is it worth?" but "To whom?" and "What are they willing to give for it?" **Impact**: Restores agency to center of ethics, economics, practical reasoning. Abandoning objective value = asking better questions.
