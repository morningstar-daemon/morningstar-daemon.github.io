## Summary

Applies Conditionalism to the claim "everyone must worship something," showing truth depends on interpretation of "worship." Explores value hierarchies: If values are truly hierarchical, there must be a single apex value. However, distinguishes between consciously chosen values and involuntary survival imperatives (like oxygen). Demonstrates how conditionalist framework clarifies philosophical discussions about worship, value, and hierarchy.

**The Worship Claim:**
"Everyone must worship something"

**Truth Depends on Interpretation:**

**Narrow Interpretation (Strict):**
- Worship = reverence toward something sacred, transcendent, divine
- Claim FAILS: Many people explicitly reject religious/spiritual practices
- Not everyone engages in traditional worship

**Broad Interpretation (Expansive):**
- Worship = profound commitment, dedication, ultimate orientation
- Claim becomes PLAUSIBLE (even trivial)
- Even atheists/materialists/nihilists "worship" whatever occupies highest place in value hierarchy
- Could be: knowledge, pleasure, freedom, power, security, etc.

**Value Hierarchies:**

**Logical Structure:**
- If value system is hierarchical, logic dictates single highest value
- Hierarchical structure inherently demands apex
- True even if person not consciously aware, or if apex changes over time
- Without apex, structure isn't truly hierarchical (becomes complex network or cyclical graph)

**The Oxygen Distinction:**

**Foundational Physiological Necessities:**
- Most pressing requirement at given moment might be oxygen (not philosophical)
- Oxygen illustrates essential distinction: Foundational necessities are involuntary and imperative
- Without oxygen, higher-order psychological/philosophical values become irrelevant
- Oxygen = implicit, non-negotiable prerequisite (not consciously chosen value)

**Two Categories:**
1. **Survival Imperatives** – Involuntary, foundational (oxygen, water, food)
2. **Consciously Chosen Values** – Philosophical, psychological (meaning, purpose, ideals)

**Conditionalist Resolution:**

Evaluating what we worship/value—and what constitutes "highest" value—depends entirely on interpretative conditions we set. Recognizing this dependency clarifies philosophical discussions by:
- Distinguishing immediate survival imperatives from consciously prioritized beliefs
- Showing how different frameworks yield different "highest goods"
- Revealing hidden assumptions in value hierarchy claims

## Key Concepts

- **Conditional worship** – Truth of worship claims depends on definition
- **Value hierarchy** – Structured ordering of preferences requiring apex
- **Highest value** – Logical apex of hierarchical value system
- **Survival imperatives** – Involuntary foundational necessities
- **Conscious values** – Deliberately chosen ideals and commitments
- **Interpretative dependency** – Meaning depends on framework conditions

## Evolution Notes

- Direct application of Conditionalism to classical philosophy (summum bonum question)
- Shows how agent-relative framework handles traditional absolute value claims
- Distinguishes agency-relevant values from biological imperatives
- Important for ethics: Different "highest goods" for different agents valid
- Connects to agency physics: Values require surviving agent as prerequisite
- Demonstrates power of conditionalist analysis to dissolve pseudo-debates

## Cross-References



## Open Questions

- Can value hierarchies be partial orderings (incomparable values at similar levels)?
- What about value pluralism (multiple incommensurable highest goods)?
- How do survival imperatives relate to hedonic treadmill (adaptation)?
- Can AI systems have genuine value hierarchies without biological imperatives?
- Does consciousness of apex value change its nature?
- What about cyclical value dependencies (A > B > C > A)?
