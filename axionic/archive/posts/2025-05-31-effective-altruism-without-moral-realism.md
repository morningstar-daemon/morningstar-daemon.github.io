## Summary

**EA = intellectually rigorous moral movement, but assumes objective value (fundamental error).** EA encourages thinking critically about maximizing good (reducing suffering, extending lives, mitigating x-risk). **The flaw**: Assumes values not just effective, but objectively true. **If value is subjective**: EA = coherent voluntary framework, but no universal moral claim. **Problem with utilitarian foundation**: (1) Maximizing utility requires interpersonal utility comparisons (whose values aggregated?). (2) No objective vantage exists. (3) If moral imperatives = preference expressions, "maximize utility" only duty for those endorsing that metric. **Can't justify universality** without smuggling objective value. **No meta-agent** to weigh everyone's values from above. Nature indifferent, God silent, reason doesn't generate values. **Reframing EA**: Not universal moral program, but high-agency moral identity—voluntary, consensual, internally coherent, agent-owned. It's a LARP (but one that saves lives). **Strengthening EA**: Drop moral realism illusion → becomes community of agents acting on shared values, not missionaries enforcing absolutes. In universe without objective value, only morality that matters = one you choose. EA = good choice—just don't pretend it's "true" or only rational one.
