## Summary
This sequence reveals the hierarchical structure beneath all strategic action, progressing from the observation that every game sits within a larger game to the quantum substrate where patterns compete for amplitude-weighted continuity. The six-post progression establishes that persistence is the terminal criterion, incentives rewrite lower-level rules through downward causation, patterns (not people) are the real units of selection, and ultimately survival becomes a competition for measure across decohering quantum branches. The sequence provides the conceptual backbone for understanding strategy, agency, and coherence at every scale.

## Key Concepts
- **Game hierarchy** – Every game sits inside a larger metagame; confusion arises from misidentifying which game you're playing.
- **Persistence as terminal criterion** – The ultimate metagame: patterns compete for continued existence across time.
- **Incentives as downward causation** – Incentive gradients shape behavior and determine outcomes more than explicit rules.
- **Patterns as selection units** – Stable information configurations outlive individuals and propagate across hosts.
- **Quantum metagame** – Deepest layer: patterns compete for amplitude-weighted measure across decohering branches.

## Evolution Notes
- Integrates game theory, evolutionary dynamics, and quantum mechanics into unified strategic framework.
- Demonstrates how classical survival is merely surface phenomenon of deeper quantum persistence.
- Shows how incentive analysis connects individual strategy to civilizational evolution.

## Open Questions
- How do we measure pattern coherence across branches empirically?
- Can agents consciously optimize for quantum-level persistence, or only classical approximations?
- What strategic implications follow from recognizing the quantum metagame explicitly?
