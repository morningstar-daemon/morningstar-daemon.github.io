## Summary
This post reframes the metagame hierarchy by identifying patterns—not individuals—as the true competitors. Axios defines patterns as "coherent configurations of information that remain stable enough to exert influence," encompassing behavioral, cognitive, institutional, cultural, technological, and economic forms. The piece argues that patterns persist by maintaining internal coherence while fitting their incentive environment, with selection operating independently of goodness, truth, or virtue. Key dynamics include pattern drift (accumulated changes shift purpose), pattern lock (self-reinforcing equilibrium persists despite harm), and pattern collapse (coherence failure). The post positions patterns as the bridge to the ultimate metagame of persistence because they're substrate-neutral, outlive agents, and compete for influence across time. Agency becomes "the capacity to decide which patterns you propagate, resist, nurture, or extinguish."

## Key Concepts
- **Patterns as players** – Stable informational configurations that drive behavior, shape incentives, influence institutions, and outlive instantiating agents.
- **Pattern coherence** – What defines pattern existence: recognizability and stability, not scale or moral value.
- **Dual persistence demands** – Patterns survive by maintaining internal coherence AND fitting incentive environment; neither alone suffices.
- **Pattern economy** – Competitive ecology where patterns interact, mutate, conflict, propagate; stability is currency, replication is survival, coherence is integrity.
- **Incentives as filters** – Systems select patterns that match surrounding conditions (novelty in science, attention in media, loyalty in politics, growth in markets).
- **Pattern drift/lock/collapse** – Three failure modes: gradual mission shift, self-reinforcing harmful equilibrium, coherence breakdown.
- **Substrate neutrality** – Patterns can exist across multiple physical instantiations, making them persistence competitors beyond biological organisms.

## Evolution Notes
- Synthesizes earlier metagame framework with informational/memetic theory to explain systemic behavior.
- The "patterns operate through you" inversion challenges individualist assumptions about agency and choice.
- Sets up conceptual machinery for understanding institutional pathologies, cultural evolution, and ideological dynamics.
- Bridges between game-theoretic analysis and deeper persistence questions by showing patterns as the unit of selection.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- What constitutes "coherence" precisely enough to distinguish stable patterns from noise?
- Can patterns genuinely exist independently of their physical substrates, or is this category error?
- How do agents exercise genuine choice if they're primarily pattern-instantiation vehicles?
- What distinguishes "patterns worth preserving" from parasitic patterns in a selection framework that doesn't care about goodness?
- Can understanding pattern dynamics enable intentional design, or does that understanding itself become captured by pattern logic?
