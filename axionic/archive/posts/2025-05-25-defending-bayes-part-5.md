## Summary

Extends credence taxonomy beyond timeline uncertainty. **Four valid credence types:** (1) **Timeline/Indexical uncertainty** (primary; which branch am I on?), (2) **Logical/Mathematical uncertainty** (unresolved proofs, computational limits; e.g., trillionth π digit = 7?), (3) **Conceptual/Semantic uncertainty** (vagueness, definitional ambiguity; e.g., "baldness at <500 hairs"), (4) **Metaphysical/Ontological uncertainty** (fundamental nature claims; e.g., consciousness requires biology?). **Refinement:** Part 2 said credence = timeline uncertainty; now acknowledges broader scope while maintaining timeline as central in empirical contexts. **Meta-credence:** ~95% confidence this taxonomy is exhaustive (self-reflexive application). Completes Defending Bayes series with comprehensive credence theory.
