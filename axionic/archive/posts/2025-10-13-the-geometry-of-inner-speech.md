## Summary
This essay reframes inner speech not as predictive simulation of auditory feedback but as geometric projection from high-dimensional conceptual space into lower-dimensional auditory subspace. Actual speech involves coordinated activation across motor, somatosensory, auditory, linguistic, and social circuits forming a full manifold. Inner speech collapses this manifold into a partial rendering that preserves auditory and semantic modes while suppressing motor output—creating a "sensory shadow" or "cortical hologram." Neuroimaging shows inner speech activates the same auditory cortex regions as actual hearing, but via top-down expectations without bottom-up error signals. The projectional model dissolves boundaries between thinking, remembering, and imagining—all are traversals of the same representational space, differing in which coordinates are active. Inner dialog feels like remembered dialog because both are sensory projections of conceptual structures. The essay concludes that all conscious modalities may be projections from high-dimensional representational fields onto perceivable manifolds—"observing the geometry of thought collapse into sound."

## Key Concepts
- **Projection vs. prediction** – Inner speech as dimensional reduction from conceptual manifold to auditory subspace, not merely temporal prediction.
- **Sensory shadow** – Compressed linguistic signal preserving some modes (auditory/semantic) while suppressing others (motor/external).
- **Cortical hologram** – Sound-field rendered in auditory cortex without corresponding air vibrations or sensory input.
- **Top-down activation without error signals** – Descending expectations in auditory cortex without bottom-up sensory confirmation.
- **Projectional physics of thought** – Universal principle: mind perceives itself by projecting internal dynamics onto perceivable manifolds.
- **Introspection as projection** – Vision, audition, proprioception as internal surfaces where thought becomes observable to itself.

## Evolution Notes
- Applies geometric/mathematical framework to cognitive phenomenology, characteristic of Axio's physics-first approach.
- Connects to broader Axio interest in how consciousness arises from computational/physical structures.
- The manifold collapse metaphor echoes quantum measure theory and dimensional reduction themes elsewhere in the archive.
- Positions inner speech as special case of general principle rather than sui generis phenomenon.
- The dissolution of thinking/remembering/imagining boundaries anticipates later work on continuity of cognitive processes.
- Treats subjective experience as geometric property of representational spaces—naturalizing phenomenology.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- What determines which dimensions are preserved vs. suppressed in different projection modes (visual imagery, proprioception, etc.)?
- Can we empirically measure the "dimensionality" of conceptual space before and after projection, or is this purely theoretical?
- How do atypical cognitive profiles (aphantasia, hyperphantasia, agrammatism) map onto this projectional framework?
- Does the projectional model apply to non-linguistic thought, or only to verbally structured cognition?
- What is the relationship between inner speech projection and the language of thought hypothesis—are concepts pre-linguistic or inherently verbal?
- Could AI systems implementing similar projection mechanisms develop inner speech phenomenology, or is biological embodiment necessary?
- How does the projectional model handle multilingual inner speech—are different languages separate projection operators or variants of one?
