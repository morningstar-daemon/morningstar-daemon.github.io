# [Understanding Requires Models](https://axionic.org/posts/179013388.understanding-requires-models.html)

**Date:** November 15, 2025  
**Series:** Epistemology / Philosophy of Science  
**Source:** Sean Carroll & Andrew Jaffe conversation

## Core Thesis

**All empirical knowledge is mediated by models.** Cognition and scientific reasoning proceed through representational structures that mediate all contact with the world. Access never immediate—filtered through models organizing sensory input, imposing explanatory structure, supporting prediction. Understanding = capacity to formulate models successfully predicting, integrating, explaining observations.

> "Understanding consists in constructing and maintaining models that organize experience effectively. The model provides the structure within which meaning and explanation arise."

## Key Philosophical Claims

### 1. No Direct Access to Reality
- **Never unmediated:** Contact with world always through models
- **From infancy:** Rudimentary causal expectations onward
- **Continuous:** Scientific models extend ordinary cognitive architecture
- **Structured representation:** Agents interact with models, not raw reality

### 2. Model-Dependence is Fundamental
- **No model-independent interpretation available**
- Scientific observations always interpreted through frameworks
- Choice of model = choice of what to preserve/approximate
- Adequacy domain-specific (determined by preserved structural features)

### 3. Conditionalism Connection
**Every empirical claim implicitly conditional on background assumptions**

Example: "Expansion rate of universe is H" = shorthand for:
> "IF data, modeling assumptions, and cosmology parameterization accepted, THEN posterior estimate for H takes specific form"

## Model Theory Framework

### Models as Structured Simplifications

**London Tube Map Analogy:**
- Omits geographic distance, orientation
- Preserves structural relations for navigation
- Domain-adequacy, not universal truth

**Scientific Models Similarly:**
- Preserve relevant invariants
- Simplify/omit irrelevant detail
- Domain-specific accuracy

**Examples:**
- **Newtonian mechanics:** Omits relativity/quantum → accurate everyday conditions
- **General relativity:** Discards force-based → geometric account for large scales/high precision

> "The adequacy of a model is domain-specific, determined by which structural features it preserves and which it intentionally distorts."

### Map vs. Territory Refined
Not just "map ≠ territory" but:
- Maps intentionally distort
- Distortions domain-appropriate
- Preservation selective (what matters for use)
- Multiple valid maps of same territory (different purposes)

## Cognitive Architecture

### Universal Model-Based Reasoning

**Developmental progression:**
1. **Infants:** Form rudimentary causal expectations
2. **Children:** Revise internal representations through interaction
3. **Adults:** Interpret social behavior through predictive heuristics
4. **Scientists:** Formalize with mathematical models

**Common structure:** Structured expectations about environment (not unmediated perception)

### Three Inference Types

1. **Deduction:** Necessary conclusions from stipulated premises
   - Explores logical consequences of assumptions
   - Internal to model

2. **Abduction:** Inference to best explanation
   - Generates candidate explanations
   - Conceptual possibility space
   - Renders observations intelligible

3. **Induction:** Evaluating fit with observation
   - How well implications align with data
   - Updates credences

**Scientific process:** Abduction → Deduction → Induction (cycle)

## Probability as Conditional Truth

### Bayesian Framework (Jaffe)
- **Probabilities = rational degrees of belief** given model + background
- Not objective features of world
- Quantify credence distribution across competing models

**Example:** "Hubble constant 67 ± 3 km/s/Mpc" = posterior distribution conditioned on:
- Cosmological model
- Observed data
- Measurement uncertainty assumptions

### Frequentist vs. Bayesian
| Frequentist | Bayesian |
|-------------|----------|
| Long-run hypothetical experiments | Direct parameter plausibility |
| Mathematically correct but indirect | Answers actual research question |
| Error bars on procedure | Credence distribution |

**Axio interpretation:** Probability = quantitative expression of conditional truth
- Reflects agent credence distribution
- Not objective quantum Measure
- Framework-dependent

## Domain Applications

### Statistical Mechanics

**Coarse-Graining:**
- Gas: astronomical microstates (inaccessible)
- Work with macrostates: temperature, pressure, density
- Probability distribution over microstates

**Entropy:**
- Encodes model limitations
- How much work extractable given information at chosen level
- If finer information available → more work extractable
- **Second law = constraint from chosen description level**

### Quantum Mechanics

**Integration of Probability:**
- Wavefunction encodes probability amplitudes
- Interpretations (Copenhagen, Many Worlds, QBism) = meta-models
- Connect formalism to ontology

**Conditionalist View:**
- Interpretive differences = different modeling choices
- Same probabilistic structure, different organization
- Understanding = clarifying model↔measurement relation
- Not identifying unmediated ontological substrate

### Cosmology

**Parameter Inference:**
- From observational data (CMB) via models of:
  - Early-universe dynamics
  - Matter content
  - Statistical structure
- Power spectrum computed under model assumptions
- Parameter estimates depend on assumptions

**Hubble Tension Example:**
- Discrepancy between CMB-inferred vs. local distance-ladder rates
- **Fundamentally disagreement between models**
- Each embeds: astrophysics, calibration, cosmology, priors assumptions
- Resolution requires identifying inadequate modeling assumptions

**Multiverse/Anthropic:**
- Debates about model classes
- Measures over parameter spaces
- Not direct claims about unobservables

## Conditionalism Integration

### Empirical Truth = Conditional Coherence
- Truth claims in empirical domains = coherence within model
- Model successfully organizes and predicts experience
- Scientific progress = constructing/refining models with better coherence

### No Certainty, Only Coherence
- Aspiration for foundational, irrefutable knowledge doesn't align with science
- Classical rationalism ≠ actual scientific progress
- Inverse-square gravity not proven deductively
- Strongly supported because renders observations highly probable

### Model Construction as Understanding
> "The model is not merely a tool for representing the world. It is the framework within which the concept of 'the world' becomes intelligible."

**Implications:**
- Understanding ≠ direct perception
- Understanding = successful model construction
- Meaning and explanation arise within model framework
- Reality concept itself model-dependent

## Philosophical Positions

### Epistemology
- **Anti-foundationalism:** No certain empirical knowledge
- **Model-dependence:** All knowledge mediated
- **Conditionalism:** Truth conditional on framework
- **Bayesian:** Probability = rational credence

### Philosophy of Science
- **Anti-realism (naive):** No direct reality access
- **Structural realism:** Preserve invariants across models
- **Pragmatism:** Models judged by predictive success
- **Pluralism:** Multiple valid models (domain-specific)

### Cognitive Science
- **Representationalism:** Cognition operates on representations
- **Predictive processing:** Structured expectations guide perception
- **Continuity thesis:** Scientific models extend ordinary cognition
- **No given:** Even perception model-mediated

## Key Insights

1. **All empirical knowledge model-mediated:** No direct access
2. **Models selective simplifications:** Intentional distortions for domain
3. **Cognition inherently model-based:** From infancy through science
4. **Probability expresses conditional truth:** Credence, not objective fact
5. **Understanding = model construction:** Not passive reception
6. **Reality concept model-dependent:** "World" intelligible within framework
7. **Scientific progress = better models:** Coherence with experience
8. **No certainty possible:** Only conditional coherence
9. **Domain-specificity crucial:** Model adequacy contextual
10. **Three inference types:** Abduction, deduction, induction

## Implications

### For Science
- Abandon quest for certainty
- Recognize model-dependence explicitly
- Multiple models for different domains
- Progress = coherence improvement
- Parameters always conditional

### For Philosophy

- Understanding = modeling capacity
- Prediction from structured expectations
- Learning = model refinement
- Intelligence = effective model construction

### For Everyday Reasoning
- We all use models constantly
- Revise through experience
- Predictive heuristics essential
- No unmediated perception
