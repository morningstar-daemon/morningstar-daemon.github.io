## Summary

Critique of "game theoretic" approach to free speech that advocates tit-for-tat retaliation against censorship. Responds to @gummibear737's three-faction framework: Purists (free speech above all), Partisans (free speech for me, not thee), and Game Theoreticians (free speech as Nash equilibrium enforced by reciprocal deterrence). Game Theoreticians argue for "vaccination, not vengeance"—punishing censorship proportionally to prevent asymmetry.

Axio argues this approach fundamentally errs by normalizing coercion as political tactic. While superficially echoing Axio's anti-asymmetry stance, it crosses key lines:

1. **Dilutes coercion boundary:** Speech becomes coercion only with credible threat of harm. Tit-for-tat endorses retaliatory coercion, blurring the line.
2. **Risks partisan drift:** "We must censor them so they'll respect free speech later" is indistinguishable from partisan logic in practice.
3. **Self-reinforcing spiral:** Retaliation justifies further retaliation; equilibrium walks toward spiral.
4. **Legitimizes suppression tools:** Adopting enemy's methods concedes coercion is legitimate instrument—cannot walk back that concession.

Purist stance is fragile and easily gamed, but tit-for-tat alternative corrodes norms long-term. Real solution: **transparent exposure**, not symmetric coercion. Make censorship visible, undeniable, reputationally costly. Force confrontation with what it is: credible threat to silence dissent. Norms rebuilt through relentless clarity, not mimicry.

Compact (2.8KB) strategic disagreement with game-theoretic free speech defense, maintaining principled Purist position.

## Key Concepts

- **Free speech factions** – Purists (principle above all), Partisans (selective application), Game Theoreticians (equilibrium via deterrence).
- **Tit-for-tat retaliation** – Game-theoretic strategy punishing censorship proportionally to enforce norms through reciprocal deterrence.
- **Nash equilibrium framing** – Idea that free speech survives only when violations are deterred by credible counter-violations.
- **Retaliation spiral** – Risk that reciprocal coercion becomes self-reinforcing, walking from equilibrium toward escalation.
- **Transparent exposure strategy** – Alternative to retaliation: make coercion visible and reputationally costly rather than mirroring it.
- **Coercion normalization** – Danger that strategic use of suppression tactics legitimizes them as acceptable political tools.

## Evolution Notes

- **Strategic disagreement:** Nuanced rejection of superficially similar position—shows Axio isn't reflexively aligned with all anti-censorship tactics.
- **Applies coercion framework:** Directly builds on #151-152 (Boundaries of Force, Violence vs. Coercion) to critique game-theoretic approach.
- **Principled Purism:** Maintains idealistic stance despite acknowledging fragility—unusual in rationalist discourse that often favors pragmatic strategy.
- **Exposure over enforcement:** Foreshadows later transparency/sunlight themes in governance and institutional critique.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions

- **Asymmetry problem:** If Purists don't retaliate and Partisans do, won't Partisans win long-term? How do principles survive power asymmetry?
- **Exposure effectiveness:** Is reputational cost actually effective deterrent, or does it only work when audience cares about hypocrisy?
- **Historical precedents:** When has Purist stance survived bad-faith opposition without strategic retaliation? What conditions enabled it?
- **Coordination failure:** If everyone expects others to be Game Theoreticians, does unilateral Purism become suicidal?
- **Institutional capture:** When institutions systematically censor, can exposure alone defeat them without disrupting their censorship capacity?
