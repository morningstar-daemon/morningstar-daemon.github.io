## Summary

Integrates David Wallace's *The Emergent Multiverse* (MWI via decoherence) with Three Thermodynamic Laws of Agency. **Agency & Branching:** Choices = quantum outcomes; influencing measure = "quantum work" (Law 1). **Quantum Decision Theory:** Rational agents maximize quantum-measure-weighted utility (Deutsch-Wallace theorem), naturally minimizing prediction error = kybits. **Decoherence & Decay:** Entropy increase via decoherence = agency decay without energy input (Law 2). **Control Limits:** Quantum uncertainty + decoherence = impossible perfect control (Law 3). **Synthesis:** Wallace's emergent ontology provides quantum-thermodynamic landscape for agency—decisions are physical quantum events under thermodynamic constraints. Bridges quantum foundations with agency physics.
