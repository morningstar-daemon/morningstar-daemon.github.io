## Summary
This brief post advocates replacing the Eurocentric term "Middle East" with the geographically accurate "West Asia." The "Middle East" designation makes sense only from a European/British colonial perspective (between "West" Europe and "East" Asia), feeling archaic and imprecise today. The shift mirrors the successful replacement of "Oriental" with "Asian" over recent decades—demonstrating that deeply embedded labels can evolve when better alternatives gain acceptance. "West Asia" neutrally locates the region within the Asian continent, intuitive for everyone regardless of cultural perspective. Despite expected resistance from inertia (term embedded in politics, academia, media), inertia alone doesn't justify perpetuating colonial legacies. Benefits—accuracy, clarity, cultural neutrality—outweigh temporary adjustment costs. Axio urges institutions to adopt "West Asia," reflecting maturation away from Eurocentrism.

## Key Concepts
- **Eurocentric terminology** – "Middle East" reflects British colonial geographic perspective, not neutral geography.
- **Geographic accuracy** – "West Asia" correctly locates region within Asian continent.
- **Historical precedent** – "Oriental" → "Asian" shift demonstrates feasibility of large-scale terminology evolution.
- **Cultural neutrality** – "West Asia" avoids embedding specific cultural vantage point in basic geographic term.
- **Inertia vs. accuracy** – Embedded usage doesn't justify perpetuating imprecise or colonialist terms.
- **Progressive trajectory** – Language evolution corrects past misunderstandings and improves cultural sensitivity.

## Evolution Notes
- Rare example of Axio engaging with cultural terminology/naming conventions.
- Applies principles of clarity, accuracy, and agent-neutrality to geographic language.
- Connects to broader theme of interrogating inherited frameworks.
- Minor post but demonstrates attention to linguistic precision across domains.
- May inform later work on conceptual framing and terminology choices.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- What other widely-used geographic terms embed problematic perspectives?
- How do we balance descriptive accuracy against established usage in technical/diplomatic contexts?
- Could alternative terms (Southwest Asia, Western Asia) be superior?
- What mechanisms effectively drive terminology change at institutional scale?
