# [The Physics of Agency, Part 7: Branching Realities — Agency in the Multiverse](https://axionic.org/posts/162571051.the-physics-of-agency-part-7-branching.html)

**Date:** 2025-04-30  
**Series:** Physics of Agency (Part 7 of 10)

## Summary

Places Physics of Agency framework within Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI): every quantum event splits reality into diverging branches, all possible outcomes realized somewhere.

**Challenge:** If all outcomes occur, does agency matter?  
**Answer:** Yes! Agency doesn't select one exclusive future—it influences measure (weight/thickness) of outcomes across branches.

**Measure:** Each branch carries measure (squared amplitude of wavefunction). Higher measure = greater presence of observers experiencing that branch.

**Agency Shapes Measure:** Intentional actions redistribute measure among possibilities:
- Model-driven actions increase measure of preferred outcomes
- Passive drift spreads measure thinly/randomly

When you create predictive models, anticipate outcomes, and act intentionally, you engage environmental variables shaping branching measure. Kybits don't remove possibilities—they redistribute measure among them.

**Key Insight:** In deterministic multiverse, meaning found in measure. Agency = influencing flow toward particular futures. You don't control what exists; you control which outcomes flourish.

**Philosophical Implication:** Agency matters because intentional actions selectively amplify certain futures, shaping landscape of your existence across multiverse.

## Notes

- Core axionic claim: agency shapes measure distribution
- Resolves free will problem: choices matter even if all outcomes occur
- Foundation for later quantum ethics, decision theory work
- "Flourishing" concept introduced (recurs in ethics)
