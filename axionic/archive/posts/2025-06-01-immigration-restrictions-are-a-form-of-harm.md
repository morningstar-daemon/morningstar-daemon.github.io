## Summary

**Immigration restrictions widely accepted, but crucial ethical dimension overlooked**: Restrictions inherently reduce agency of individuals both sides of borders. Under framework, harm = reduction of agency through coercion/constraints. By this measure, immigration laws cause direct, substantial harm. **Would-be immigrant** seeking better prospects/safety—attempting migration reveals clear preference, willingness to sacrifice significantly. When immigration laws forcibly prevent voluntary movement, agency explicitly diminished. Freedom to act on demonstrated preferences coercively blocked. **Simultaneously harms individuals within host nation**: Employers, landlords, consumers, communities who would voluntarily benefit from immigrant interaction denied beneficial exchanges. Restrictions coercively override preferences, limiting agency/freedom of association. **From QBU perspective**: Immigration restrictions significantly narrow measure of flourishing futures available. Each coercive restriction prunes branches of potential reality where voluntary, mutually beneficial associations lead to increased prosperity/well-being. **Critics argue**: Restrictions protect domestic interests/cultural cohesion. However, unless purported harms demonstrably reduce net agency (coercion/systemic violence), arguments fail ethical test. Aesthetic preferences or vague cultural discomfort don't constitute legitimate grounds for coercive policy. **Conclusion**: Immigration restrictions = clear, significant harm. Ethical consistency demands openness policy, subject only to constraints necessary for genuine agency preservation, not cultural/nationalist aesthetics.
