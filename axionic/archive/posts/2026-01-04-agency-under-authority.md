## Summary
Examines tension between agency preservation and legitimate authority structures. Central question: when can authority be exercised without destroying agency of those subject to it? Distinguishes constitutive constraints (preserving conditions for agency) from outcome constraints (imposing substantive ends). Authority remains legitimate when it enforces action-boundaries rather than dictating outcomes—preventing harm/coercion while leaving choice-space open. Explores when delegation to authority is voluntary vs coerced, and how authority structures can degrade into domination. Key insight: agency under authority requires clear jurisdictional boundaries, exit options, and constraint-transparency. Authority claiming to optimize outcomes "for" agents rather than preserving their capacity to choose for themselves crosses into illegitimate territory. Connects to broader Axio theme: governance must preserve agency as constitutive rather than treating it as instrumental.

## Key Concepts
- **Constitutive vs outcome constraints** – Authority enforcing agency-conditions vs imposing ends
- **Legitimate authority bounds** – Action-boundaries not outcome-dictation
- **Jurisdictional clarity** – Clear scope of authority prevents creep into domination
- **Exit optionality** – Ability to leave authority structure preserves voluntariness
- **Authority vs domination** – Legitimate when preserving agency-capacity vs destroying it

## Open Questions
- Can authority scale while preserving exit optionality (network effects, coordination problems)?
- How do we distinguish constitutive from outcome constraints in novel domains?
- What minimal authority is necessary vs what becomes domination?
