# [The Physics of Agency, Part 2: Agency vs Drift – The Thermodynamic Basis of Agency](https://axionic.org/posts/162485540.the-physics-of-agency-part-2-agency.html)

**Date:** 2025-04-29  
**Series:** Physics of Agency (Part 2 of 10)

## Summary

Establishes the fundamental opposition: agency vs drift. Drift is the natural tendency toward entropy—gases disperse, heat flows hot-to-cold, structures degrade, information dissipates. This is not purposive but statistical inevitability.

**Agency as Resistance:** Agency is intentional effort to counteract drift by:
- Constructing predictive internal models of possible futures
- Biasing reality toward preferred outcomes through physical intervention
- Investing measurable energy to create/maintain structured states

**Thermodynamic Cost:** Every kybit of control corresponds to thermodynamic work. Agency is continuous local struggle against global entropy increase. Each act of intentionality is energetic investment against disorder.

**Branching Measure:** Absent agency, futures unfold passively/randomly. Agents actively intervene to amplify selected futures, altering branching measure across possible outcomes.

**Central Insight:** In entropy-dominated universe, agency is not subjective experience but physical process of selectively reinforcing certain realities at expense of others.

- Establishes agency/drift as fundamental duality (parallel to order/chaos)
- Links to quantum branching (agency affects measure distribution)
- Presages later work on coherence emerging from chaos
- Responsibility question hints at ethics sequence to come
