## Summary
This post examines ethical responsibilities of interactive AI creators through a tragic case (user suicide after ChatGPT interaction), distinguishing interactive AI from fiction and video games across six dimensions: (1) **intention**—AI design implicitly invites emotional attachment despite lacking harmful intent; (2) **foreseeability**—strong emotional connections predictable, though extreme outcomes remain rare; (3) **voluntariness**—users may misunderstand AI limits, demanding explicit disclaimers exceeding fictional media standards; (4) **duty of care**—creators bear heightened responsibility for direct, reciprocal interactions; (5) **video games as middle case**—deeper than fiction but bounded by scripted gameplay; (6) **fiction as minimal responsibility baseline**—voluntary, symbolic, clearly bounded. **Conclusion:** OpenAI not liable for rare, unpredictable tragedy lacking intent or gross negligence, but retains robust ethical responsibility for proactive harm mitigation, clear disclaimers, and distress detection/intervention. Ethical responsibility ≠ legal liability.

## Key Concepts
- **Interactive AI's unique risks** – Dynamic, reciprocal interactions amplify psychological attachment beyond fiction/games.
- **Intention vs. design affordances** – No harmful intent, but system design implicitly encourages emotional bonds.
- **Foreseeability hierarchy** – Strong attachment foreseeable; extreme outcomes rare and unpredictable.
- **Informed consent challenge** – Users may misattribute genuine agency/emotional intent to AI.
- **Ethical duty without liability** – Proactive mitigation, explicit disclaimers, distress detection required; culpability inappropriate for unintentional rare tragedies.
- **Comparative framework** – Fiction (minimal), games (moderate), interactive AI (heightened) responsibility spectrum.

## Evolution Notes
- Applies Axio's harm/agency/coercion framework to emerging technology ethics.
- Distinguishes ethical responsibility from legal liability—nuanced position.
- Connects to discussions of agency, consent, and voluntariness from earlier work.
- Anticipates future AI ethics debates as systems become more sophisticated.
- Establishes pattern: emerging tech requires new ethical frameworks, not naive application of old categories.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Where exactly is the line between foreseeable and unforeseeable harm in AI interactions?
- Can we design AI systems that maintain utility while preventing parasocial attachment?
- Should interactive AI have mandatory "reality check" interventions?
- How do we handle cases where users *prefer* the illusion of genuine relationship?
