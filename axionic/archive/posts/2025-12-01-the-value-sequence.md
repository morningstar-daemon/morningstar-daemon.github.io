## Summary
This is a comprehensive index post cataloging the entire Value Sequence—Axio's systematic development of value theory from first principles. The sequence rejects both objective value ("cosmic law") and pure relativism ("anything goes") in favor of value as "the architecture of preference an agent constructs to navigate the world, constrained by coherence, opportunity cost, and the physics of agency." The 36-post sequence is organized into five parts: (0) Orientation/Viability Criterion, (I) Breaking Objective Value (7 posts), (II) Preference/Price/Exchange (7 posts), (III) Ethics as Coherent Coordination (9 posts including harm/consent/coercion definitions), (IV) Phosphorism and the Highest Good (7 posts), and (V) Edge Cases/Applied Theory (6 posts). The sequence culminates in Phosphorism—Axio's chosen value framework prioritizing life, intelligence, complexity, flourishing, and authenticity.

## Key Concepts
- **Value as architecture** – Not cosmic or arbitrary but preference hierarchy constructed under coherence constraints, opportunity costs, and agency physics.
- **Agent-bound subjectivism** – Moral claims can be objective given a vantage without being universal; distinct from mushy relativism.
- **Conditionalism** – Every truth (including moral truth) conditional on background assumptions; coherence not correspondence as core test.
- **Sacred Coherence** – Logical coherence as the defensible "sacred" at top of value hierarchy adjudicating all others.
- **Harm/Consent/Coercion definitions** – Functional definitions grounding ethics in agency: harm as viable-futures reduction, consent as persuasion/coercion boundary, coercion as credible harm threat.
- **Phosphorism** – Chosen value system explicitly prioritizing life, intelligence, complexity, flourishing, authenticity; not discovered but constructed.

## Evolution Notes
- Major sequence compilation/index post providing roadmap through Axio's core value theory.
- The five-part structure shows systematic development from foundational critique to applied theory.
- Cross-links to 36 posts spanning entire archive history (earliest referenced: 2023 posts).
- Represents culmination of multi-year philosophical project synthesizing economics, ethics, epistemology, agency theory.
- "Against Moral Extortion" highlighted as "definitive Axionic rejection of guilt-based ethics."

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Does agent-bound subjectivism genuinely avoid the problems of relativism, or just relabel them?
- Can coherence alone adjudicate between radically different but internally consistent value systems?
- Is Phosphorism genuinely "chosen" or smuggling in discovered values under constructivist rhetoric?
- What distinguishes this value framework from sophisticated consequentialism?
- How does the sequence handle cases where agents have genuinely incoherent preferences (which appears empirically common)?
