# Against the Minimum Wage

## Summary
This essay argues minimum wage laws are coercion masquerading as compassion—criminalizing voluntary agreements below arbitrary thresholds rather than granting value to labor. As price controls, they reduce demand for labor through basic economics: when cost exceeds marginal productivity, businesses automate, outsource, or don't hire. The visible effect is higher wages for those employed; the invisible effect (Bastiat's "unseen") is jobs never created, workers never gaining experience, businesses never forming. The moral tragedy is not layoffs but non-hiring: the young, unskilled, immigrant, and marginalized are locked out of entry-level work by laws claiming to help them. The policy also accelerates automation (substitution effect) and capital flight to jurisdictions without price fixing. From axiocratic perspective, this reduces agency—eliminating voluntary exchanges and blocking the feedback loop of experience. Real compassion would offer direct support (subsidies, apprenticeships, charity) without outlawing low-skill labor. "You cannot legislate value into existence. You can only ban those who would have created it."

## Key Concepts
- **Coercion disguised as compassion** – Minimum wage as credible threat of harm to gain compliance, contracting rather than expanding agency.
- **Price floor mechanics** – Basic supply/demand: raising price above equilibrium reduces quantity demanded, pricing marginal workers out.
- **Bastiat's unseen** – Invisible costs: jobs never created, experience never gained, paths to self-sufficiency blocked.
- **Non-hiring tragedy** – Moral failure is not termination but preventing employment that would have occurred voluntarily.
- **Substitution effect** – Higher labor costs accelerate automation and capital flight to lower-cost jurisdictions or algorithms.
- **Value as agency** – Ethical framework measuring value by voluntary exchange capacity rather than mandated outcomes.

## Evolution Notes
- Applies Axio's libertarian/anarchist economics to specific policy, characteristic of political philosophy posts.
- Integrates axiocratic framework (revealed preference) with traditional Austrian economics (price theory, unseen effects).
- The coercion analysis ties minimum wage to broader Axio critique of state intervention.
- Bastiat reference situates argument in classical liberal tradition.
- The "aesthetic ritual" framing treats policy as moral signaling rather than effective intervention.
- Foreshadows later posts on economic coercion, slavery, and labor markets.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- How do we empirically separate minimum wage effects from confounding factors (economic growth, technology shifts, regional variation)?
- Does the theoretical model hold across all contexts, or are there conditions where monopsony power justifies wage floors?
- What about evidence from natural experiments (Seattle, Denmark) that show minimal employment effects at moderate increases?
- If direct support (subsidies, UBI) is preferable, how do we fund it without coercive taxation (which the framework also rejects)?
- How do we handle market failures in labor pricing (information asymmetry, coordination problems, search costs)?
- Does the "voluntary agreement" framing adequately account for desperation-driven acceptance of exploitative terms?
- What prevents race-to-the-bottom dynamics where workers accept poverty wages due to lack of bargaining power?
