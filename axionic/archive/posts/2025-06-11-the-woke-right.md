## Summary
This post identifies a troubling convergence between the woke Left and elements of the political Right that mirror woke methods while claiming to oppose them. Six parallel pathologies emerge: narrative over facts, omnipresent grievance culture, identity epistemology, enforced conformity/purity spirals, illiberal censorship, and dogmatic rejection of Enlightenment liberalism. James Lindsay and Konstantin Kisin's term "Woke Right" captures this symmetry—both sides abandon empirical reason and liberal principles for tribal identity and collective grievance. Axio argues this reveals a deeper psychological pattern: humans naturally gravitate toward tribalism unless checked by liberal institutions. Alternative labels include "Reactionary Identitarianism" or "Counter-Enlightenment Right." The solution is defending liberal principles and rigorous evidence standards, not mirroring the enemy's methods.

## Key Concepts
- **Woke Right** – Right-wing movement mirroring woke Left's methods: grievance, identity politics, anti-liberalism.
- **Parallel pathologies** – Six structural similarities: narrative/emotion over reason, victimhood culture, identity epistemology, conformity enforcement, censorship, anti-Enlightenment stance.
- **Psychological pattern** – Tribalism and narrative simplicity are human defaults requiring deliberate cultural effort to resist.
- **Pinker-esque insight** – Liberalism and rationalism aren't natural states; they demand continuous vigilance.
- **Method mirroring** – Fighting wokeism by adopting its methods is self-defeating (like establishing Inquisition to fight dogmatism).
- **Reactionary identitarianism** – Alternative label emphasizing backward-looking collective identity focus.

## Evolution Notes
- Applies Axio's liberal framework to critique *both* political extremes—not just traditional Left targets.
- Demonstrates intellectual consistency: principles matter more than tribal allegiance.
- Connects to "Instinct For Submission" theme: tribalism as psychological default.
- Later work will explore how to institutionally resist these patterns.
- Establishes Axio's position as orthogonal to Left/Right tribal politics.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can institutional design prevent these parallel pathologies from emerging?
- Is there an asymmetry in which side's methods are more dangerous long-term?
- How do we distinguish legitimate conservatism from reactionary identitarianism?
- What minimal shared liberal principles are necessary for productive cross-tribal dialogue?
