## Summary
This post makes foundational assumptions explicit, functioning as architectural specification that conditions inquiry rather than persuades. Defines scope boundary: acceptance places reader within framework's domain, rejection places outside—neither carries further implication. **Epistemic**: (1) Conditionalism—all claims relative to background structure; semantic interpretation precedes evaluation. **Physical**: (2) Everettian QM—unitary evolution, no collapse; (3) Objective probability as branch measure (ontic, not epistemic); (4) Counterfactuals as physical branches. **Probabilistic**: (5) Credence as epistemic uncertainty—tracks which branch agent occupies; sharply distinct from measure. **Value-theoretic**: (6) Moral subjectivism—value agent-relative; (7) No outcome guarantees (survival/welfare/benevolence). **Agency-theoretic**: (8) Agency as authorship—transitions within admissible evaluation domain; (9) Harm as agency reduction—structural, not experiential; (10) Coercion as credible threat of harm. The commitments are layered: Axionic Commitments → Axionic Agency → Axionic Constitution → downstream alignment. Establishes that framework makes claims only within defined conditional domain, not universal applicability.

## Key Concepts
- **Conditionalism** – All truth/evaluation/interpretation relative to background structure; enables factual realism with interpretive discipline
- **Everettian substrate** – Many-worlds QM as physical foundation; branching without collapse
- **Measure vs. credence** – Objective (physical branch weight) vs. epistemic (uncertainty about branch location)
- **Counterfactuals as branches** – Physical alternatives, not stipulated possible worlds
- **Moral subjectivism** – Value agent-relative; normative structure concerns coherence/authorship/admissibility
- **Agency as authorship** – Meaningful transition selection within admissible domain
- **Harm as structural reduction** – Loss of agency capacity, not suffering/preference-violation
- **Scope boundary** – Framework conditional on these commitments; alternative ontologies occupy different spaces

## Evolution Notes
- Makes implicit background assumptions explicit for first time
- Prevents upstream interpretive failures and misreadings
- Establishes conditional rather than universal claims
- Provides reference point for "what framework presupposes"
- Distinguishes between framework-internal and framework-external disagreements

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Are these commitments truly necessary, or could some be relaxed while preserving core results?
- How much of the framework survives under collapse-interpretation QM or other physics?
- Could measure-credence distinction be maintained under alternative probability interpretations?
- What happens when agents disagree about which commitments hold?
- Can the framework engage productively with moral realists, or does subjectivism preclude dialogue?
- How do we handle cases where physical substrate makes some commitments empirically inaccessible?
