## Summary

Critiques xkcd's famous "free speech" comic for **reducing free speech to narrow legal definition** (government non-arrest), ignoring cultural practice, ethical convention, epistemic safeguard. **Three errors:** 1) Legalism masquerading as philosophy, 2) Erasing non-government coercion (employers, mobs, platforms), 3) Trivializing agency role of speech. **Better frame:** Free speech = **conditional freedom from coercion to express criticism** (not just state coercion). Speech amplifies agency by enabling criticism → correction → knowledge growth.

## Key Concepts
- **Legalism vs philosophy** – Statute ≠ substance of free speech
- **Erasure of coercion** – Non-state actors can coerce too
- **Agency amplification** – Speech enables criticism → correction → knowledge
- **Conditional free speech** – Depends on absence of coercion (all types)
