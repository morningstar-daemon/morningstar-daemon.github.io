# Against Cosmological Idealism

**Date:** October 21, 2025

## Summary
Critiques Michael Murray's cosmological idealism (mind precedes matter). Argues it revives creation ex nihilo, smuggling consciousness into ontological ground. Realism: matter/information fundamental, consciousness emergent. Core insight: Idealism solves no problems realism doesn't, while adding unexplained primitive (cosmic mind).
