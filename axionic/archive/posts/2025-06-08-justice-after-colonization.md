# [Justice After Colonization](https://axionic.org/posts/165499243.justice-after-colonization.html)

**Date:** 2025-06-08  

## Summary

Proposes agency-restoring approach to post-colonial justice. Rejects coercive redistribution in favor of voluntary, capacity-building initiatives.

**Key Concepts:**

**Rejecting Coercive Redistribution:**
- Punitive reparations from uninvolved descendants creates new injustices
- Undermines agency, perpetuates cycles of harm
- Justice requires nuanced, principled response

**Principles for Ethical Restoration:**

**1. Acknowledgment and Transparency:**
Truthful acknowledgment of historical injustices; denial perpetuates harm

**2. Voluntary, Conditional Restitution:**
- Where identifiable harms persist (broken treaties, land claims)
- Through negotiated, voluntary agreements
- Must respect all parties' agency

**3. Agency-Enhancing Charity:**
Restore agency, don't foster dependency. Must:
- Empower indigenous autonomy and self-determination
- Prioritize voluntary, consensual participation
- Operate with transparent conditional agreements
- Foster sustainable capacity-building

**Charitable Examples:**
- Educational/cultural initiatives chosen by communities
- Legal advocacy for property rights
- Economic self-sufficiency: entrepreneurship, vocational training, infrastructure

**Avoiding Unintended Harms:**
Explicitly avoid dependency-creating or paternalistic programs

**Central Principle:** Real justice involves agency restoration, not coercive redistribution. Empowerment over patronization.
