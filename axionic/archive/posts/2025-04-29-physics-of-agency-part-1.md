# The Physics of Agency, Part 1: The Physical Nature of Agency

**Date:** April 29, 2025  
**Batch:** Batch 01 (Posts 001–020)

## Summary
Opening the flagship series, this post argues that agency is not a mystical psychological artifact but a thermodynamic process. An agent is defined as a system that spends energy to bias the branching weight of future timelines, and the essay introduces the kybit as the quantitative unit of such intentional control. The piece reframes deliberation, meaning, and responsibility as physical feats accomplished against entropy rather than as purely mental abstractions.

## Key Concepts
- **Physical agency** – Intentional choice is cast as a measurable intervention in the multiverse, not just metaphorical willpower.
- **Kybits** – Proposed unit of control analogous to bits for information, foreshadowing later quantitative laws.
- **Branch biasing** – Agency is described as selectively amplifying preferred branches within the many-worlds wavefunction.

## Evolution Notes
- Establishes the thermodynamic lens that future posts will formalize into explicit laws of control, decay, and limits.
- Connects Axio’s launch promise to investigate “technology, mind, and value” with a concrete physical model, grounding the archive in physics-first reasoning.

## Open Questions
- What empirical measurements could validate kybits as a distinct unit beyond analogies to information theory?
- How might embedded AI systems instrument their own energy expenditure to audit agency in real time?
