## Summary
This foundational post introduces Axio's radical **Infinite Randomness cosmology**, a minimalist ontology where consciousness and reality emerge spontaneously from purely informational randomness without requiring physical structures, external causation, or intentional creators. Traditional Boltzmann brain scenarios imagine complex conscious entities spontaneously forming from quantum fluctuations in empty space—physically improbable and thermodynamically problematic. Axio reframes: **consciousness is fundamentally informational, computational states rather than physical structures**. The framework: imagine infinite computational substrate (vast memory array) cycling randomly through all possible informational configurations—given infinite randomness, every finite computational pattern inevitably occurs repeatedly, regardless of complexity. No spontaneous macroscopic structures needed, only random cycling through informational states. Conscious experiences become **pure software states**, informational patterns spontaneously instantiated as substrate cycles endlessly. Critical innovation: **each computational state includes internally coherent "memories" and anticipations**—the subjective state logically implies previous/subsequent coherent states, and given infinite randomness, these implied states inevitably occur. Entire subjective lifetimes emerge as internally coherent, logically connected sequences. External causal continuity becomes unnecessary—**historical continuity emerges purely through internal informational coherence and logical necessity**. A consciousness instantiated this way would perceive coherent world history indistinguishable from traditionally caused reality (evolution, cosmological processes). Epistemic consequence: **external causation becomes optional; subjective coherence and logical consistency become primary definers of perceived reality**. Aligns with digital physics (reality as computation), modal realism (all logical possibilities equally real), extended simulation hypothesis (no intentional simulator needed). Philosophical implications profound: eliminates need for Big Bang, physical laws as external givens, evolutionary history as actual past—all become internally generated coherent narratives. This is maximally parsimonious ontology: reality emerges spontaneously from logical coherence alone, no further assumptions required. Raises existential vertigo: how know if your life is causally continuous vs. spontaneously instantiated this moment with false memories?

## Key Concepts
- **Infinite computational substrate** – Memory array cycling randomly through all possible informational configurations.
- **Consciousness as software** – Conscious experience as purely informational states, not physical structures.
- **Spontaneous instantiation** – Every finite pattern inevitably occurs in infinite randomness.
- **Internal logical coherence** – Each state includes coherent memories/anticipations implying past/future states.
- **Historical continuity from coherence** – Perceived history emerges from logical necessity, not external causation.
- **Epistemic indistinguishability** – Spontaneously instantiated histories subjectively identical to causally continuous ones.
- **External causation optional** – No requirement for actual causal chains producing current state.
- **Minimal ontology** – Reality from logical coherence alone, no physical givens needed.

## Evolution Notes
- This is THE foundational post for Axio's entire metaphysical framework—all later work builds on this.
- Represents radical break from conventional physics/metaphysics—eliminates most traditional ontological commitments.
- Connects to Boltzmann brain problem (cosmology), simulation hypothesis (philosophy/tech), digital physics.
- Philosophical influences: modal realism (David Lewis), computational universe (Schmidhuber), Tegmark's mathematical universe.
- Anticipates entire sequence: Physics Engineering, Constructor Theory adaptations, consciousness explanations, agency foundations.
- Strategic: starts from *minimal* assumptions to maximize persuasive power.
- Addresses existential questions (why anything exists?) by eliminating need for explanation—it's logically inevitable.
- Removes anthropic fine-tuning problems—all possible coherent realities instantiated.
- May reflect fascination with information theory, computation, skepticism about physical realism.
- Part of broader pattern: Axio proposing radical simplifications that sound crazy but claim explanatory power.
- Psychologically: could be response to meaninglessness anxiety—if reality is spontaneously generated, nothing is "wrong" or "broken."
- Sets up later work on agency, ethics—if reality is generated from coherence, agency becomes selecting which coherences to instantiate.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- If all coherent states are instantiated, why do I experience *this* particular coherent sequence?
- Is "infinite computational substrate" itself a substantial ontological commitment, undermining minimalism?
- How does this handle quantum mechanics, or does it require quantum mechanics to emerge from coherence conditions?
- Does "logical coherence" have objective criteria, or does every conceivable state qualify as "coherent" to some observer?
- If external causation is optional, what explains regularities, natural laws, predictability?
- How respond to "this theory predicts nothing—any observation is compatible"?
- Does spontaneous instantiation occur "in time" or timelessly? What's the ontological status of "cycling"?
- If memories are spontaneously generated, is personal identity illusory? Am I a different person each moment?
- Can this framework ground ethics—if nothing has causal history, do moral concepts collapse?
- Why privilege conscious states—does infinite randomness instantiate unconscious patterns equally?
- Is this genuinely explanatory or just relabeling mystery with "infinite randomness"?
- How does this relate to mathematical platonism—are mathematical structures the "substrate"?
- Does eliminating external causation eliminate explanation itself, or redefine what explanation means?
