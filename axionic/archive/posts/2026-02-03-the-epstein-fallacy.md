## Summary
This essay responds to a critique claiming moral subjectivism fails because it can't show "sound deliberative route" for someone like Epstein toward refraining from atrocity. The argument's structure: extreme case (maximally revolting figure) + demand that acceptable moral theory must show how they could reason out of evil + failure to do so = refutation. Axios argues critique mislocates burden. Moral subjectivism is thesis about grounding (where moral judgments derive authority/content), not about psychological reachability of moral reform for particular agents. Subjectivists can hold: Epstein's actions maximally condemnable relative to evaluator's values + Epstein had profoundly corrupted motivations + given those, no internally coherent deliberative path to restraint (Williams: if no sound deliberative route from existing motivations to action, false to say agent has internal reason to perform it). This isn't concession—it's implication of taking agency seriously. Critique smuggles in rationalist assumption: moral obligation tied to deliberative accessibility, moral truth universally accessible through reason—not supplied by subjectivism. Owning implication clarifies: Epstein may have acted coherently with his own values (horrifying, descriptive fact); absence of internal reasons doesn't erase judgment, limits what it accomplishes. Moral judgment: expression of evaluative stance, basis for exclusion/constraint/prevention, coordination guide among non-sharers—doesn't require uptake by target. Deeper assumption: universal redeemability (every agent reachable by reason); when elevated to philosophical requirement, becomes distortion. Agency doesn't guarantee corrigibility; some value systems malignant and stable.

## Key Concepts
- **Moral grounding vs. deliberative accessibility** – Subjectivism addresses where judgments derive authority/content, not psychological reachability of reform; collapsing these is category error.
- **Williams on internal reasons** – If no sound deliberative route from existing motivations to action, false to say agent has (internal) reason to perform it; subjectivism accepts this without excuse or judgment erosion.
- **Loaded accessibility demand** – Critique assumes moral obligation tied to deliberative accessibility (rationalist framework); subjectivism faulted for failing standard only objectivist theories impose.
- **Coherence ≠ excuse** – Admitting agent acted coherently with own values (descriptive) doesn't excuse (normative); horrifying fact, not moral catastrophe.
- **Judgment without uptake** – Moral judgment doesn't require target reform to be meaningful; expression of stance, basis for exclusion/constraint/prevention, coordination among non-sharers; requires coherence among wielders, not target reception.
- **Universal redeemability myth** – Belief every agent in principle reachable by reason = emotionally appealing, philosophically distorting; agency doesn't guarantee corrigibility; some value systems malignant and stable.
- **Terminal agency failure** – Some agents cannot be deliberatively reached; framework acknowledging this without collapsing isn't defective, is honest; morality doesn't rescue us from this, it confronts it.
- **Moral condemnation ≠ motivational leverage** – Absence of internal reasons doesn't erase judgment, just limits what judgment can accomplish practically.

## Evolution Notes
- Applies Axionic agency framework to meta-ethics debate, showing how structural understanding of agency informs moral philosophy.
- The Williams reference grounds the argument in established philosophical literature (internal/external reasons distinction).
- Clarifies that Axionic/subjectivist position doesn't excuse evil but refuses to pretend moral reality guarantees psychological accessibility.
- The "terminal agency failure" concept connects to earlier discussions of agency collapse—some agents structurally irreparable.
- Positions moral judgment as coordination tool among compatible agents, not universal reform mechanism.
- The "universal redeemability myth" critique challenges both religious and secular humanist assumptions.
- Demonstrates how honest reckoning with agency limits strengthens rather than weakens moral framework.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- If moral judgment doesn't require uptake by target, what distinguishes it from mere preference expression?
- Can subjectivism ground substantive moral criticism of others' value systems, or does it collapse into relativism?
- What's the practical difference between "Epstein had no internal reason to stop" and "Epstein was evil"—do they recommend different responses?
- If some value systems are terminally malignant, does that imply preemptive constraint is justified—how does this relate to "The Price of Agency"?
- Can the internal/external reasons distinction be applied to AI systems—do they have "internal reasons" in Williams's sense?
- If universal redeemability is myth, what does that mean for rehabilitation-focused criminal justice?
- Does acknowledging terminal agency failure strengthen or weaken case for defensive action/containment?
