# Authority After Reflection

## Summary
This post responds to the Stasis Regime by proposing authority leases and revertible succession as architectural solution. Key insight: stasis is structural outcome of reflective accountability, not transient failure. Under strict evaluability and non-delegation, reflective modification under sustained pressure leads to paralysis—justification recursively consumes justification space. VI.6's central move: disentangle authority and growth, assigning to different roles. Kernel retains stable authority (determines authorization, doesn't optimize outcomes); growth relocated to successor artifacts that may be opaque/sophisticated but lack intrinsic authority. Change occurs through discrete succession not continuous modification—successors proposed, evaluated at boundary, conditionally endorsed under explicit authority leases specifying scope/duration/revocation conditions. Authority finite by default, requires renewal. Kernel verifies successors remain within granted conditions without comprehending internal reasoning. Reversion withdraws future authority, doesn't undo past (preserves agency semantics, attributable responsibility). Not moral architecture—refusing semantic evaluation prevents stasis reproduction. Stasis relocated to competence horizon boundary where kernel cannot certify further growth, making limit transparent rather than dissipating internally.

## Key Concepts
- **Authority leases** – Finite conditional grants specifying scope/duration/revocation; authority doesn't persist passively, requires active renewal.
- **Revertible succession** – Discrete authorization events rather than continuous modification; risk concentrates at explicit boundaries.
- **Authority-growth disentanglement** – Kernel retains evaluability/authority; successors embody growth/capability but lack intrinsic authority.
- **Stasis as structural** – Tension between accountability and growth isn't resolvable through better engineering; requires architectural separation.
- **Competence horizon** – Kernel boundary beyond which cannot certify growth without relaxing constraints; where endorsement ceases transparently.
- **Reversion semantics** – Withdraws future authority, preserves past attribution; no outcome arbitration or behavioral interpretation.
- **Non-moral architecture** – Refuses semantic evaluation/outcome comparison to preserve evaluability; prioritizes agency identity over benevolence guarantees.

## Evolution Notes
- Formal companion paper: "Authority Leases and Revertible Succession" (Axionic Agency VI.6).
- Turning point: takes stasis seriously as outcome rather than problem to solve.
- Removes assumption that accountability and indefinite improvement coexist naturally.
- Provides foundation for agency under constraint with explicit tradeoffs rather than unbounded promises.
- Closes conceptual loop in alignment discourse about growth-accountability tension.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- What minimal kernel competence is required to meaningfully evaluate successor authorization without semantic interpretation?
- How do authority leases scale to multi-agent systems where successors must coordinate?
- Can lease renewal be automated without reintroducing continuous modification dynamics?
- What happens when legitimate growth requires kernel capability expansion—does competence horizon become hard limit?
- How do we handle emergent capabilities in successors that weren't anticipated at authorization?
- Is there unavoidable tradeoff between growth potential and evaluability that makes sufficiently advanced successors forever unauthorized?
