# The Cybernetics Sequence

**Date:** 2025-11-19  
**Series:** Cybernetics Sequence (Announcement/Index)

## Summary

Sequence announcement and index post. Introduces cybernetics as framework for understanding agency, control, and consciousness through model-based processes.

**Key Concepts:**

**Core Principle:** Every form of effective regulation requires a model. Models enable systems to:
- Discriminate states
- Anticipate consequences
- Adjust behavior to preserve goals

**Theme:** How representation, control, and agency emerge from model-based processes (biological, artificial, theoretical)

**Posts in Sequence:**

1. **Understanding Requires Models:** Cognition as conditional structure; knowledge is model-mediated
2. **Control Requires Models:** Good Regulator Theorem; reliable control requires embodying model of regulated system
3. **Models, Beliefs, and Agents:** Distinguishes internal regulatory models from interpretive-level beliefs
4. **Lookup Tables and Agents:** Minimal models in biological/artificial systems; condition-action mappings as degenerate models
5. **What Is a Model?:** Defines models across scientific, biological, cognitive settings
6. **Principia Cybernetica:** Historical/conceptual bridge; early systematization of cybernetic epistemology

**Central Insight:** Model-based architecture supports prediction, explanation, control. Agents require structured representations to act coherently.
