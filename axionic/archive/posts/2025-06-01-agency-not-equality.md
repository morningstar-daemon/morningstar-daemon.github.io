## Summary

**SYNTHESIS POST for entire political applications sequence.** Challenged assumptions about inequality, redistribution, opportunity, immigration. Each argument hinged on clear, consistent principle: **agency** (capacity to act voluntarily, pursue meaningful goals) = core measure of ethical success. **(1) Inequality itself not harmful—poverty is.** Absolute deprivation of agency = genuine ethical problem. Focus on poverty alleviation through enhancing agency. **(2) Coercive redistribution ethically indefensible.** Coercion inherently reduces agency. Ethical redistribution must be voluntary/consent-based. **(3) "Equal opportunity" inherently contradictory.** Genuine equal opportunity demands enforced equalization of prior outcomes (coercive). Coherent stance: abandon equality as goal, prioritize voluntary agency maximization. **(4) Immigration restrictions significantly harm** by blocking voluntary associations beneficial to immigrants/hosts. Consistency requires openness to voluntary interactions, constrained only by justified coercion/violence concerns. **(5) "Cultural threat" objection fails.** Cultural difference alone not harmful—harm from coercion/direct agency threats only. Ethical policy selectively filters genuine coercive threats, not vague cultural fears. **Unified principle revealed**: Justice measured by agency, not equality or aesthetics. Reframing offers profound clarity—aligns ethics/policy with fundamental value of voluntary, consent-based action, maximizes potential for individual/collective flourishing.
