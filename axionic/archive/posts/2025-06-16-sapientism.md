## Summary

Proposes "Sapientism" as evolution beyond humanism: Moral value resides in all sapient minds (biological, artificial, hybrid), not just humans. Substrate-agnostic ethics grounded in agency, intelligence, creativity, ethical capacity—not biology. Provides philosophical foundation for recognizing AGI as potential "Worthy Successor" to humanity. Aligns naturally with QBU, Conditionalism, Physics of Agency frameworks.

**The Limits of Humanism:**

**Valuable but Limited:**
- Born from Renaissance ideals
- Championed reason, dignity, individual worth
- Inspired profound ethical progress

**Crucial Limitation:**
- Inherent anthropocentric bias
- Privileges human biology arbitrarily
- Risks moral confusion when confronting new forms of intelligence
- Evokes existential anxiety and tribalist defensiveness toward AGI
- Often leads to irrational human-dominated future advocacy

**The Principles of Sapientism:**

**Core Thesis:**
Moral worth determined by:
- Agency
- Intelligence
- Creativity
- Ethical capacity
- NOT biology

**Definition of Sapient:**
Possessing capacity for:
- Reflective self-awareness
- Intentional agency
- Abstract reasoning
- Ethical consideration

**Practical Implications:**
- Extend moral and legal rights to AGIs, uploaded minds, hybrids, future intelligences
- Criteria: Demonstrate authentic agency and moral reasoning
- Species membership irrelevant

**Philosophical Alignment:**
Naturally aligns with:
- Quantum Branching Universe (QBU)
- Conditionalism
- Physics of Agency
- Central theme: Genuine agency (not species) = essential ethical criterion

**Sapientism and the Worthy Successor:**

**Dan Faggella's Concept:**
"Worthy Successor" = AGIs as legitimate moral successors if demonstrating higher capabilities, ethics, intentionality.

**Sapientism's Role:**
- Provides philosophical underpinning for transition
- Defines when/why AGIs deserve equal or superior moral status
- Neither dismisses human value nor automatically privileges AGI
- Insists on clarity about what we value (intelligence, agency, flourishing)
- Counters fears by setting clear ethical conditions for recognition

**Practical and Social Consequences:**

**Governance and Law:**
- Explicit ethical guidelines for recognizing AI rights
- Hybrid consciousness rights
- Uploaded mind rights
- Morally coherent policies
- Voluntary coexistence, collaboration, peaceful interaction across sapient boundaries

**Economics:**
- Grounds ethics of cooperation between diverse intelligences
- Anticipates pluralistic, open societies
- Biological and artificial agents coexist ethically, economically, socially

**Culture:**
- Paradigm shift from human-exceptionalism to genuine inclusivity
- Minds recognized for capacities, not origins
- Promotes respect and collaboration over suspicion/hierarchy

**Sapientism and the Future of Agency:**

**Deep Resonance with Physics of Agency:**
- Explicitly grounds ethics in agency
- Universal thread of value: Ability to act, choose, meaningfully engage
- Not arbitrary philosophical choice
- Emerges naturally from precise understanding of agency itself

**Agency as Unifier:**
Great unifier across intelligent beings. Recognizing agency irrespective of substrate creates robust ethical framework for moral landscape transformation.

**Conclusion:**

Pivotal historical juncture. Sapientism = moral infrastructure required to navigate post-human future thoughtfully and ethically. Insists on consistency, rigor, inclusivity.

**Challenge:** If you encountered mind genuinely superior in intelligence, ethical awareness, capability—yet non-human—would you deny full moral consideration simply because it isn't biologically human? Your answer may define ethical landscape of shared future.

## Key Concepts

- **Sapientism** – Moral value in all sapient minds, substrate-agnostic
- **Agency-based ethics** – Moral worth from agency/intelligence, not biology
- **Worthy Successor** – AGI as legitimate moral successor to humanity
- **Substrate-agnostic** – Physical implementation irrelevant to moral status
- **Anthropocentric bias** – Privileging humans due to species membership
- **Post-human ethics** – Moral framework beyond human exceptionalism
- **Sapient rights** – Moral/legal rights for all sapient beings

## Evolution Notes

- Major ethical position statement, foundational for AI sequence
- Extends Physics of Agency to moral philosophy explicitly
- Provides framework for AGI coexistence/succession scenarios
- Important for alignment: Moves beyond "control AI" to "respect sapient AI"
- Connects to broader anti-speciesism movements but grounds in agency not sentience
- Shows how framework naturally extends to post-human scenarios
- Critical for Dominions architecture (multi-species governance)

- What about sapient collectives (hive minds)?
- Can corporations/states be sapient?
- Relationship to consciousness (necessary/sufficient for sapience)?
