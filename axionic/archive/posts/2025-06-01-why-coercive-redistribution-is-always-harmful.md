# Why Coercive Redistribution Is Always Harmful

**Date:** 2025-06-01  

## Summary

**Redistribution defended by compassion/fairness/social justice—but does method itself cause harm?** Under framework, harm = reduction of agency through coercion. Coercion = credible threat of actual harm for compliance. By definition, coercive redistribution (enforced via imprisonment/fines threats) **inherently harmful** because reduces agency of those from whom resources taken. **Intention irrelevant**: Compassionate intentions don't erase harm to those coerced. "Net good" cannot ethically justify imposing harm on individuals. Framework rejects benefiting one group justifies harming another. **Doesn't imply ignoring poverty/deprivation**: Calls for voluntary, consent-based methods. Voluntary redistribution (charity, mutual aid, opt-in safety nets) respects agency, upholds consent, avoids coercion ethics pitfalls. **Additional problems**: Coercive redistribution distorts incentives—discourages voluntary charity, creates dependency, reduces productivity/innovation by penalizing success. When coercion removed, voluntary solutions arise naturally, preserving incentives, promoting genuine solidarity. **Conclusion**: Coercive redistribution always harmful—not because helping others wrong, but because coercion inherently reduces agency and violates ethical integrity. Not compassionate to fund charity through extortion. True compassion respects voluntary action/agency, seeks solutions free from force threat.

- Applies definitional framework to policy
- "Always harmful" = categorical claim
- Provocative but logically consistent within framework
