## Summary

This post defends the coherence of sex-based definitions of sexual orientation against identity-based frameworks that ground orientation in subjective self-identification. Axio argues that the sex-based framework (heterosexuality = attraction to opposite sex, homosexuality = same sex, bisexuality = both) remains analytically coherent precisely because it anchors to an external, stable reference point: biological sex as reproductive category. In contrast, identity-based definitions (where a man dating a trans woman is classified as heterosexual based on declared gender) create contradictory classifications and collapse distinct categories into incoherence.

The post references Colin Wright's response "It's OK to be gay" as effective rhetoric that exposes the underlying problem: recasting same-sex attraction as heterosexuality reveals implicit judgment that being labeled straight is preferable. This suggests that identity-based redefinitions are motivated by stigma-avoidance rather than descriptive accuracy. If being gay or bisexual is truly legitimate, there should be no need for semantic disguise.

**Core Argument:** Sexual orientation must remain anchored to biological sex, not gender identity, or the categories cease to perform their intended function of mapping empirical patterns of human attraction. The choice is between maintaining clarity via stable biological reference or surrendering to incoherence where homosexuality and heterosexuality can collapse into each other based on shifting identity claims.

This is a rare explicitly culture-war-adjacent post in the archive, departing from Axio's usual focus on abstract philosophy and physics. It defends conceptual clarity and stable reference points against postmodern fluidity — themes consistent with broader axionic commitments to objective reality and measurable properties.

## Key Concepts

- **Sex-based orientation framework** – Defines sexual orientation relative to biological sex (male/female reproductive categories), yielding stable, coherent classifications.
- **Identity-based orientation framework** – Grounds orientation in subjective gender self-identification, making classifications contingent on shifting identity claims.
- **Objective anchor** – External reference point (biological sex) that prevents category collapse and maintains descriptive function.
- **Category collapse** – Phenomenon where identity-based definitions allow homosexuality and heterosexuality to reverse based on participants' self-labels.
- **Implicit stigma revelation** – Identity-based redefinition reveals underlying judgment that being labeled straight is preferable to gay/bi, undermining claimed legitimacy.

## Evolution Notes

- **Unusual culture-war engagement:** Most of Axio's archive focuses on abstract philosophy, physics, and political theory. Explicit engagement with gender/sexuality debates is rare.
- **Consistency with realism:** Mirrors broader axionic commitment to objective reality, measurable properties, and rejection of pure social construction (see quantum realism, physics of agency).
- **Conceptual stability theme:** Echoes arguments about stable reference frames throughout archive — categories must be anchored to survive contact with reality.
- **Contrast with typical axionic scope:** This post is narrower and more culturally specific than Axio's usual sweeping frameworks. Suggests willingness to engage specific cultural flashpoints when conceptual clarity is at stake.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions

- **Intersex and orientation:** How does sex-based framework handle cases where biological sex is ambiguous? Does this undermine the "stable anchor" claim?
- **Evolution of categories:** Can orientation categories evolve while remaining sex-anchored? Historical homosexuality definitions varied significantly — what makes current framework definitive?
- **Transmed positions:** Does Axio's framework allow for transsexual (not transgender) orientations where post-transition sex determines classification?
- **Political implications:** Is this post arguing for specific policy (bathrooms, sports, pronouns) or purely defending conceptual clarity without political prescription?
- **Attraction to sex vs. gender presentation:** How does framework handle cases where attraction patterns track gender presentation (femininity/masculinity) rather than chromosomal sex?
