## Summary
This post challenges the notion that projects can possess inherent value beyond the sum of individual subjective valuations. Axio rejects objective value theory, asserting that **the value of any project is precisely the aggregate of actual individual valuations—no more, no less**. The common belief that infrastructure, research, or education has intrinsic worth independent of voluntary support commits a philosophical error: value doesn't exist without subjective evaluation by agents. Potential hypothetical benefits don't constitute actual value. The ethical implication is stark: **if a project isn't voluntarily funded, it's not valuable enough to pursue**. This respects individual agency, aligns with voluntarist ethics, and resolves tensions between hypothetical benefit and actual value. Collective action problems are structural incentives, not inherent value discrepancies, solvable through voluntary mechanisms like assurance contracts.

## Key Concepts
- **Subjectivist value theory** – Value arises exclusively from individual preferences; no value exists independent of subjective evaluation.
- **Actual vs. hypothetical valuation** – Projects might theoretically benefit people, but speculative preferences don't equal actual value.
- **Objective value fallacy** – Asserting inherent worth presupposes external objective standards that don't exist.
- **Voluntary funding threshold** – If project lacks voluntary support, it's definitionally not valuable enough to pursue.
- **Collective action vs. inherent value** – Coordination problems are structural, not indicators of value discrepancies; solvable voluntarily.
- **Future preferences** – Speculative valuations of nonexistent people can't justify coercive funding today.

## Evolution Notes
- Applies agent-binding subjectivism to practical decision-making about projects/funding.
- Connects value theory to political ethics (voluntarism vs. coercive taxation).
- Anticipates later work on public goods, taxation, market provision of services.
- Provides clear decision criterion: voluntary funding = viability threshold.
- Frames "kill the project" as ethical clarity, not cold pragmatism.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- How do we handle projects with long time-horizons where current valuations are highly uncertain?
- Can we distinguish between "ignorant undervaluation" and "genuine low value" without paternalism?
- What about network effects where value emerges only after critical mass adoption?
- Are there any legitimate exceptions where coercive funding is ethically justified?
