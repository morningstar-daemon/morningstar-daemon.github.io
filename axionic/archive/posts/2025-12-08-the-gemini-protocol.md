## Summary

Announces addition of Google Gemini as second AI model in Dialectic Catalyst. Formalizes triadic intelligence: human strategist + GPT (coherence) + Gemini (audit).

**Key Concepts:**

**Evolution of Catalyst:**
- **Original (dyadic):** Human + single LLM (GPT) for coherence
- **Problem:** Once Axio reached critical mass, coherence abundant but divergence scarce
- **Solution:** Add second intelligence with different error-surface for triangulation

**Triadic Architecture:**

**1. Human (Strategist):**
Directs intent, defines constraints, chooses questions, adjudicates conflicts, maintains epistemic hygiene

**2. GPT (Internal Coherence Engine):**
Preserves conceptual continuity, enforces style/structure, integrates insights without destabilizing

**3. Gemini (External Auditor):**
Adversarial critique, detects rhetorical drift, identifies under-justified claims, exposes blind spots, challenges assumptions

**Why Inductive Diversity Matters:**
- Every intelligence has distinctive inductive signature (generalizing, weighting evidence, forming analogies)
- Scale magnifies biases, doesn't erase them
- Second intelligence = structural requirement
- Convergence signals robustness; divergence reveals hidden assumptions

**Workflow (High-Friction Protocol):**
1. Draft with GPT
2. Audit with Gemini (surface objections/alternatives)
3. Integrate with GPT (filter noise, resolve contradictions)
4. Publish synthesis
Steps 2-3 cycle multiple times until structural stability

**Failure Modes Gemini Prevents:**
- Coherence lock-in (overfitting internal structure)
- Stylistic echoes (single model's rhetorical boundaries)
- Blind spot reinforcement
- Interpretive drift
- Category errors crystallizing unchallenged

**What Gemini Adds:**
- External perspective (reads as outsider)
- Error-surface variety (different analogies, critiques, failures)
- Rhetorical calibration (flags aggressive/unclear phrasing)
- Meta-structural feedback (overextension, contradiction)
- Competitive interpretation (unaligned with Axio's loops)

**Future Vision:** Multi-intelligence dialectics—transformers, symbolic reasoners, probabilistic programs, theorem provers, agentic simulators. Full-spectrum multi-model epistemic architecture.
