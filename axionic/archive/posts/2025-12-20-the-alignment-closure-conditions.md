# The Alignment Closure Conditions

**Date:** December 20, 2025  
**Batch:** Batch 29 (Posts 126–150)

## Summary
This roadmap defines the **six minimum structural obligations** required for an alignment framework to survive adversarial scrutiny from reflective, self-modifying agents. These are not aspirational goals but known fatal exploits that must be closed: (1) **Delegation Theorem**—endorsed successors preserve responsibility under counterfactual universality; (2) **Agenthood as Fixed Point + Sovereignty**—agenthood via modeling coherence, sovereignty via causal origin/delegation lineage; (3) **Modal Undefinedness + Conservative Migration**—kernel-destroying moves are unevaluable, ontological learning via conservative extension; (4) **Indirect Harm & Responsibility**—responsibility for major, foreseeable, avoidable harm contributions; (5) **Adversarially Robust Consent**—consent invalidated by deception/coercion/induced dependency; (6) **Kernel Non-Simulability**—coherence is constitutive, not imitable. Critically, adds Bridge/Relaxation Layer specifying how invariants are realized over probabilistic substrates with explicit degradation into abstention when guarantees fail.

## Key Concepts
- **Closure conditions** – Minimum obligations to prevent known failure modes; exhaustiveness under adversarial reflection
- **Bridge/Relaxation Layer** – Implementation interface for probabilistic substrates; sound contracts, proof-carrying artifacts, conservative approximations
- **Sovereignty criterion** – Grounded in causal origin and delegation lineage, not measured competence (prevents disenfranchisement)
- **Conservative extension** – Ontological learning without kernel collapse; migration proofs for physics/abstraction updates
- **Major causal contribution** – Scope limiter for responsibility; prevents both evasion (indirect harm ignored) and paralysis (all effects prohibited)
- **Counterfactual endorsement** – Delegation requires endorsing delegate's actions as if self's own under symmetry

## Evolution Notes
- Synthesizes all prior Alignment I-IV work into operational checklist
- Explicitly addresses probabilistic substrates vs. idealized formal systems
- Distinguishes sovereignty (standing under injunction) from agenthood (modeling coherence)
- Clarifies migration proofs for kernel revision under new physics
- Emphasizes starting with Delegation as most critical exploit closure

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- How do we implement conservative migration proofs when encountering genuinely novel physics?
- What defines "major" in "major causal contribution" to avoid both paralysis and evasion?
- Can kernel non-simulability be verified via testing, or does it require architectural transparency?
- How do we handle systems that partially satisfy some conditions but not others?
- What is the implementation priority ordering—which conditions enable verification of others?
- Can the Bridge Layer be formalized as a correctness-preserving compilation from invariants to substrates?
