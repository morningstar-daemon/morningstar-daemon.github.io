## Summary
This post demonstrates that once value is treated as agent-relative and subject to drift (per Conditionalism and Axionic Commitments), the concept of a final authoritative world arrangement becomes **ill-typed**. There is no "correct" end-state that all agents must converge to, because values evolve with interpretation and world-models. This forces political design to abandon closure in favor of plurality-preserving meta-architectures (like Dominions) that maintain agency without enforcing convergence. Utopia—understood as terminal political closure—is not merely undesirable but conceptually incoherent for reflective agents with diverging semantic phases.

## Key Concepts
- Utopia as ill-typed concept for agent-relative values
- Terminal political closure incoherent under value drift
- Plurality-preserving meta-architectures as alternative
- Agent-relative value evolution
- Semantic drift preventing convergence
- Political design without closure
