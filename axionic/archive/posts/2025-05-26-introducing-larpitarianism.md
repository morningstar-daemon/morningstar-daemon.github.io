## Summary

Novel political philosophy: **"Everybody should be free to LARP; nobody should be forced to LARP."** LARP = Live Action Role-Playing; extends to all social roles/identities. **Core concepts:** (1) **Agency/Autonomy**—freely choose roles without coercion. (2) **Authenticity**—genuine self-expression, reject enforced conformity. (3) **Consensual Participation**—mutual consent for all social/cultural/political roles; always opt-in/out. (4) **Playful Exploration**—creativity, experimentation essential. **Conditionalism connection:** Social life = performative (Goffman); roles context-sensitive constructs. **Contrasts** with coercive ideologies imposing rigid roles. **Practical:** Voluntary community-building, cultural openness, educational role-play. **Responds to critiques:** Not frivolous—supports well-being, innovation, diversity. Playful yet serious political philosophy grounded in voluntarism.
