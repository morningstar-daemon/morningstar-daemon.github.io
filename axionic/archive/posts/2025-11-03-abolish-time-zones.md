## Summary

A crisp argument for universal UTC adoption: time zones are "last superstitions of the analog age"—invented for trains/telegraphs, not networks. All meaningful coordination already happens in digital space running on UTC. Time zones introduce entropy (errors, missed meetings, bugs, DST confusion). Cultural adaptation (e.g., Spain eating "midnight" dinner) proves humans can decouple clock time from solar position. UTC isn't just simpler—it's inevitable.

## Key Arguments

**Current Reality:**
- Nearly every technical system uses UTC internally (databases, satellites, trading, blockchains)
- Humans only subsystem pretending sun defines when things happen
- Every time zone conversion introduces errors

**The Proposal:**
- Adopt universal time tomorrow—no physics change needed
- "09:00 UTC" = start of workday regardless of local sun position
- Cultural adaptation precedes reform (already happening)

**Objections Dismissed:**

1. **"But daylight?"**
   - Daylight doesn't need to coincide with arbitrary numbers
   - We already adapt schedules to light/heat/custom
   - "Morning" and "evening" are local phenomena, not global standards

2. **"But confusing!"**
   - Only temporarily (like metric conversion)
   - Once universal, confusion vanishes

3. **"But I like my time zone!"**
   - Nostalgia not argument
   - Time zones to time what cubits were to length—provincial units sustained by inertia

**Path Forward:**
- Make UTC canonical in all digital systems and public communications
- Display local daylight equivalents only as annotations
- Stop pretending clocks should mirror sky

**Result:** Coordination becomes frictionless. Eliminate whole class of misalignment from civilization's cognitive stack.

## Relation to Axio Framework

- **Coordination:** reduction of entropy in civilizational systems
- **Standardization:** coherence through shared reference frames
- **Inevitability:** technical systems already converged; human conventions lagging
- **Axiocracy:** rational coordination over tradition

## Style Note

Short, punchy, pragmatic. Classic Axio style for operational proposals. Opens with future historians framing, closes with "Sun will still rise—but it will no longer dictate the time."
