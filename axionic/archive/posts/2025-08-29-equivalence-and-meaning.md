## Summary

Formalizes how **semantic filters act as quotient maps**, collapsing bitstrings into equivalence classes where each class = one coherent world. The key mathematical move: different strings can map to same trajectory—they're equivalent under semantic interpretation. This makes precise the idea that **meaning emerges not from individual bitstrings but from partition structure induced by semantics**.

**From Strings to Trajectories:** Exclusion filter picks F ⊆ Chaos. Semantic filter S: F → T maps strings to trajectories (T = lawful state evolutions). Each string x ∈ F interpreted as trajectory τ = S(x).

**Equivalence Classes:** Different strings can map to same trajectory: S(x₁) = S(x₂) = τ. These belong to same equivalence class. Preimage S⁻¹(τ) = {x ∈ F : S(x) = τ} = all strings generating trajectory τ. **Semantic filter partitions F into equivalence classes, each = one lawful world.**

**Examples:**
- Redundant encoding: semantic filter ignores every second bit → 0101… and 0001… map to same trajectory
- Quantum histories: measurement outcomes differing only in decohered positions map to same physical trajectory

**Invertibility:** 
- One-to-one: every string = unique trajectory
- Many-to-one: strings collapse into classes, detail lost, quotient structure remains
- One-to-many: single string → multiple worlds (rare, usually avoid)

**Why This Matters:** Coherence = survival + identification (treating different sequences as same world). Meaning is quotient structure, not raw sequences.

**Arc Position:** Chaos → Exclusion → Semantic Partition → Constructors → Life/Consciousness

## Key Concepts

- **Quotient maps** – Collapsing sets via equivalence relations
- **Equivalence classes** – Strings mapping to same trajectory
- **Partition structure** – How semantics groups strings into worlds
- **Preimage** – Set of strings generating one trajectory
- **Many-to-one mapping** – Detail loss in semantic interpretation

## Evolution Notes

Adds rigorous mathematical structure (category theory flavor) to Chaos framework. The quotient map formalism is standard in abstract algebra/topology, showing Axio importing sophisticated math tools. Prepares for constructor formalization (Post 116).

## Open Questions

What's the algebraic structure of equivalence classes? Can we define operations? How does this relate to topos theory?
