## Summary

Rights are not natural law but socially enforced preferences maintained by collective commitment and institutional design. They fragment under pressure (war, crisis, coordination failure). Durability requires: clear boundaries, enforceability, cultural consensus, and continuous maintenance. No rights are self-sustaining; all require active protection.

## Key Concepts

- **Rights as forged preferences** – Social constructions requiring enforcement, not inherent properties
- **Fragmentation under pressure** – Rights collapse when institutions fail or consensus breaks
- **Maintenance requirement** – Continuous cultural/institutional work needed to sustain rights
