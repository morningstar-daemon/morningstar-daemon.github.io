## Summary

Defines "game" against Wittgenstein's family resemblance critique: **Game = interactive process where strategy (deliberate selection among alternatives toward preferred outcomes) is salient.** Four elements: agency, strategy, interaction, goals. Then defines **intelligence = effectiveness at achieving goals within a game's constraints.** Different intelligences = proficiency in different implicit games (career, social, scientific). Solves general vs domain-specific intelligence debates by recognizing context-dependence. Responds to Wittgenstein by embracing abstraction—captures strategic core without enumerating rules. Practical: clarifies intelligence measurement, AI evaluation, educational goals.
