## Summary
This comprehensive index post organizes Axio's political philosophy into "Axiocracy"—a governance framework where coherent agency replaces authority and collective sentiment as the organizing principle. The sequence progresses through four parts: coercion theory (precise definitions of threats and force), libertarian structures (rights as protocols), economics and policy (markets as agency-preservation systems), and civilization coordination (evolution toward voluntary governance). It shows how accepting Axio's formal definitions of harm, consent, and coercion leads to radical conclusions about legitimate political authority and the trajectory of civilization.

## Key Concepts
- **Axiocracy** – Political system organized around protecting and expanding coherent agency rather than authority or democratic sentiment.
- **Coercion formalism** – Precise operational definition: credible threat of actual harm to gain compliance, distinct from persuasion, bribery, and force.
- **Rights as protocols** – Rights understood not as metaphysical truths but as strategic boundaries agents enforce through social cooperation.
- **Agency Protection Principle** – Refined alternative to NAP: coercion justified if and only if it prevents or remedies violations of voluntary agency.
- **Voluntary coordination** – The trajectory of civilization as converting coercive political structures into voluntary protocol-based governance.

## Evolution Notes
- Integrates scattered Axio political analysis into unified systematic framework across four progressive domains.
- Demonstrates how accepting formal Axio definitions (harm, consent, coercion) generates consistent libertarian conclusions.
- Frames political evolution as thermodynamic trend: civilization gradually converts coercion into coordination, shrinking politics toward obsolescence.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can voluntary governance scale to global coordination without reverting to coercive structures under stress?
- What transition mechanisms could move existing states toward protocol-based governance without catastrophic disruption?
- How would Axiocracy handle genuinely irreconcilable conflicts between agents with incompatible values?
