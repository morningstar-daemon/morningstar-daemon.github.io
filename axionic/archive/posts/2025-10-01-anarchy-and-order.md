## Summary

Anarchy doesn't mean chaos but absence of imposed hierarchy. Spontaneous order emerges from voluntary coordination (markets, norms, reputation systems) without central authority. Distinguishes descriptive anarchy (no rulers) from prescriptive anarchism (no rulers should exist). Defense of emergent order against both authoritarian imposition and nihilistic disorder. Order is possible—even robust—without monopoly governance.

## Key Concepts

- **Spontaneous order** – Self-organizing systems without central control
- **Descriptive vs prescriptive** – Anarchy as fact vs anarchy as ideal
- **Voluntary coordination** – Markets, norms, reputation as order-generating mechanisms
