## Summary
This post resolves the apparent paradox of whether agency maximization can justify parasitism (refusing to pay debts while enlarging one's option space). Axios argues that agency is a systemic property of multi-agent environments, not a private commodity, and that attempting to maximize individual agency by exploiting the trust substrate is self-defeating. The piece redefines debt as "quantified deficit of agency"—recognition that one agent has constrained another's viable futures and owes restitution. The structural argument: unpaid debts propagate through systems, eroding trust and increasing verification overhead, ultimately degrading the agency substrate itself. The synthesis: "Maximize agency" is the physics, "Pay your debts" is the engineering—both are structurally fused aspects of the same coherent system.

## Key Concepts
- **Agency as networked** – Agency depends on predictable expectations, reliability of commitments, stability of cooperation; not isolated will but systemic property.
- **Debt as agency deficit** – Not primarily financial but quantified recognition that one agent has constrained another's futures through harm/error/exploitation/reliance.
- **Parasitic agency** – Local gains achieved by exploiting trust reservoirs, which shrink the global substrate making genuine agency possible.
- **Agency conservation law** – Restore what you reduce; compensating harm is necessary to prevent degradation of the agency substrate.
- **Accounting layer** – Debt repayment as the mechanism preserving trust infrastructure; when accounting collapses, agency collapses.
- **Civilization as agency engine** – High-agency cultures (Renaissance Italy, Dutch mercantile) honor commitments; low-agency (feudal, kleptocratic) operate in coercive equilibria.

## Evolution Notes
- Resolves potential objection to agency maximization framework by showing it requires systemic maintenance, not just individual optimization.
- The "maximize agency" / "pay your debts" synthesis positions Axio as neither purely consequentialist nor deontological.
- Connects abstract agency theory to concrete institutional analysis (commercial republics vs. kleptocracies).
- The "debt is quantified agency deficit" reframing is novel contribution to both agency theory and ethics.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- How do you quantify agency deficits precisely enough to determine appropriate restitution?
- Can the framework handle cases where debts are genuinely unpayable (catastrophic harm, death)?
- Does "restore what you reduce" adequately capture obligations that arise from non-harm-based commitments (promises, contracts)?
- What institutional mechanisms can enforce debt repayment without themselves becoming coercive parasites on the agency substrate?
