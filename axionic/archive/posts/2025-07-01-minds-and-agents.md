## Summary
This post defines agents and minds with careful precision, exploring their relationship. Agent: system (physical/virtual) with four essential properties—(1) predictive modeling (generates internal representations, predictions about self/environment), (2) counterfactual reasoning (evaluates alternative outcomes, hypothetical scenarios), (3) goal-oriented action selection (chooses among alternatives based on goals), (4) causal efficacy (exerts measurable environmental influence). Examples: humans, animals, autonomous robots, sophisticated virtual simulation agents. Mind: informational subsystem instantiated within agent, defined by (1) reflective self-modeling (explicitly represents itself, internal states, capabilities), (2) internal representation and meta-cognition (reasons about own cognitive processes), (3) dynamic goal evaluation/revision (adjusts goals, predictive strategies through reflective evaluation). Examples: human cognition, potentially advanced AI systems. Key relationship: minds necessarily depend upon agents for meaningful instantiation. Agents can exist without minds (simple robots, thermostats)—minds cannot meaningfully exist without agents. Minds inherently informational subsystems within agents performing reflective, meta-cognitive functions. Portability (transferring mind between agents) contingent property, not definitional requirement: human minds generally non-portable (biological brain-bound), AI minds may be portable (software movable between computational substrates). Hierarchical structure: Agent → Mind subsystem. Agents without minds possible (simpler reactive/non-reflective systems); minds without agents impossible (require agent-context for causal grounding, meaningful activity).

## Key Concepts
- **Agent definition** – System with predictive modeling, counterfactual reasoning, goal-oriented action, causal efficacy.
- **Mind definition** – Informational subsystem with reflective self-modeling, meta-cognition, dynamic goal revision.
- **Hierarchical dependency** – Minds subsystems of agents; agents can exist without minds, minds cannot exist without agents.
- **Causal grounding** – Minds require agent-context for meaningful activity, environmental interaction.
- **Portability contingency** – Mind transfer between agents possible but not definitional; depends on substrate.
- **Meta-cognition criterion** – Minds distinguished by capacity to reason about own cognitive processes.

## Evolution Notes
- Part of ongoing project defining fundamental concepts (agent, mind, consciousness, intelligence).
- Integrates earlier Physics of Agency work with consciousness/cognition taxonomy.
- Establishes terminology for later alignment, AI, virtual environment discussions.
- Reflects computational/functionalist view: minds as information-processing subsystems.
- Distinguishes simple agency (reactive systems) from reflective agency (minds).
- Anticipates mind-uploading, AI consciousness, virtual agent discussions.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can group entities (corporations, nations) qualify as agents with collective minds?
- What's the minimum threshold for predictive modeling/counterfactual reasoning to constitute agency?
- Do all minds require consciousness, or can unconscious meta-cognition exist?
- How does the framework handle distributed/swarm intelligence—one mind, many agents?
- Can biological evolution be modeled as agent-like without mind?
- Does the definition exclude important edge cases (plants, immune systems, markets)?
- How fine-grained is the agent/mind distinction—could sub-personal systems qualify as agents?
