## Summary
Argues free expression requires defending even despised speech. Hate speech bans: (1) empower authorities to define "hate," (2) drive harmful ideas underground, (3) prevent open refutation, (4) set censorship precedents. Core insight: Protecting offensive speech is bulwark against authoritarianism; sunlight better disinfectant than suppression.
