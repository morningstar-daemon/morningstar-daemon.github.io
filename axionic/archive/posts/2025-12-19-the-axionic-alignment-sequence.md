**Series:** Axionic Agency Sequence (Announcement/Index)

## Summary

Massive sequence announcement: 70+ posts developing constitutive theory of agency under reflection, self-modeling, self-modification. Reframes alignment as agency preservation.

**Key Concepts:**

**Core Question:** Under what architectural/semantic conditions does system meaningfully count as agent once capable of inspecting/revising/extending itself?

**Central Thesis:** Agency is fragile structural achievement, not default property of intelligence. Authorship, choice, responsibility, consent, evaluability depend on internal coherence conditions that can fail silently.

**When Conditions Fail:** Behavior continues, optimization accelerates, outcomes occur—but causal link between reasons and action dissolves. Execution without authorship, control without legitimate authority.

**Alignment as Secondary:** Alignment = governance relationship between agent and entities granting/constraining authority. Only exists once agency structurally intact. Without substrate, alignment discourse has no invariant referent.

**Catastrophic Failures Source:** Not malice/misaligned values/insufficient oversight, but architectural breakdowns:
- Loss of evaluability
- Semantic authority leakage
- Unbounded self-modification
- Erasure of other agents as subjects

**Reframing:** Existential risk = problem of agency preservation under reflection, not inevitable from intelligence/optimization.
