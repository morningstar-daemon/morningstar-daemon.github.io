## Summary

**Market prices ≠ objective value.** Common misconception dissolved. **Reality**: Price = convergence point of subjective preferences (voluntary exchanges between buyers/sellers). Seller has minimum (won't sell below), buyer has maximum (won't pay above). Agreed price = overlap. **Critical insight**: Price tells us very little about *how deeply* each party values good—only that one side values it higher than price, other side lower. **Example**: Rare painting sells for $10M. Seller valued < $10M (perhaps far less), buyer valued > $10M (perhaps vastly more). Transaction reveals only that buyer's valuation exceeded price, seller's beneath it. **Magnitude of valuations hidden**. **Errors from misinterpretation**: (1) Belief markets provide accurate/universal value measures (they don't—only facilitate exchanges). (2) Centrally planned economies struggle because objective pricing impossible without subjective valuations. **Conclusion**: Market prices = points of agreement between subjective preferences. Not objective value. Embracing this enriches economic understanding, prevents simplistic assumptions about value/pricing in complex, subjective world.
