## Summary
Challenges "genetic immortality" notion—that genes live on through descendants. Genetic recombination means most of "your" DNA disappears in few centuries. Each generation: 50% dilution. After 10 generations (~250 years), <0.1% remains. Core insight: Biological continuity is illusion; cultural/intellectual legacy more durable than genetic.
