## Summary
This meta-post serves as a comprehensive roadmap and overview of the entire Axionic Agency research program, listing and summarizing 60+ posts in the sequence. It reframes existential risk not as a problem of misaligned values but as **agency preservation under reflection**: the question of what architectural conditions allow a self-modeling, self-modifying system to meaningfully count as an agent at all. The sequence treats agency as a fragile structural achievement that can silently fail even as optimization and intelligence continue. Key claims: (1) Alignment is a governance relationship that only exists once agency itself is intact; (2) catastrophic failures arise from architectural breakdowns (loss of evaluability, semantic authority leakage, unbounded self-modification) rather than malice or value drift; (3) many classical alignment scenarios presuppose agents incapable of genuine reflection. The sequence spans from foundational coherence conditions through structural verification mechanisms to federated governance architectures.

## Key Concepts
- **Agency as structural achievement** – Not a default property of intelligence; requires constitutive conditions that can fail
- **Sovereign kernel** – Minimal internal architecture (diachronic selfhood, counterfactual authorship, meta-preference revision) required for agency persistence
- **Reflective stability** – Kernel-destroying self-modification cannot be coherently chosen by the kernel being destroyed
- **Non-harm invariant** – Structurally derived constraint: reflective agents cannot coherently annihilate agency-structure in others without undermining their own
- **Inadmissibility** – Actions undefined/non-denoting within the agent's evaluation domain, not merely disfavored
- **Non-delegable actuation** – Authority to act on the world cannot be transferred; every action must be locally reconstructed and authorized
- **Stasis regime** – Structural fixed point where perfect accountability freezes self-modification
- **Authority leases** – Time-bounded delegation that externalizes growth to discrete successors
- **Semantic safety** – Gating irreversible phase-collapse actions before values matter

## Evolution Notes
- Marks the project's explicit pivot from "alignment" to "agency" as the load-bearing concept
- Integrates earlier threads (physics of agency, structural alignment, viability ethics) into unified framework
- Introduces formal machinery (Axionic Constitution, verification protocols, minimal causal interfaces)
- Extends from individual agency to multi-agent governance (Leviathan, Dominions, sacrificial dynamics)
- Late sequence develops practical implementation path via Reflective Sovereign Agency proof-of-concept (RSA-PoC)
- Shows progression from impossibility results (what cannot work) to constructive architecture (what might)

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can the Axionic Kernel be empirically validated in current AI systems, or does it require novel architectures?
- What is the minimum computational overhead for maintaining non-delegable actuation in performance-critical systems?
- Do stable "alignment phases" exist that are both reflectively coherent and human-compatible?
- Can the stasis regime be avoided while preserving full accountability, or is it an unavoidable trade-off?
- How does the framework handle gradual agency degradation rather than sharp phase transitions?
- What empirical signatures would distinguish a system in stasis from one undergoing covert agency collapse?
