## Summary

Introduces **Effective Decision Theory (EDT)**, inspired by physics' Effective Field Theory (EFT). **Problem:** Traditional Expected Utility Theory struggles with paradoxes like Pascal's Mugging and St. Petersburg, where improbable high-impact outcomes dominate rational analysis. **Solution by analogy:** EFT in physics ignores phenomena beyond certain energy scales because they have negligible observable effects. EDT similarly sets a probability cutoff below which outcomes are treated as effectively zero. **Core principles:** (1) Practical probability threshold prevents negligible-probability scenarios from dominating; (2) Contextual adaptation — cutoff varies by decision context, stakes, data quality; (3) Coherence within defined domain, sacrificing theoretical completeness for practical effectiveness. **Justification:** Extremely low probabilities involve high epistemic uncertainty and modeling ambiguity. **Related approaches:** Formalizes Nicolausian discounting (Bernoulli's St. Petersburg heuristic), compatible with Entropic Value at Risk (EVaR). **Open questions:** Rigorous threshold selection, adaptive frameworks, formal coherence.
