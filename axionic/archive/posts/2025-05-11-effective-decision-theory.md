## Summary

*[Note: Content not fetched—inferring from title/context]*

Develops decision theory framework consistent with QBU/conditionalism. Likely addresses: decision-making under quantum branching (expected value across branches), agent-relative utility, counterfactual reasoning with Strong PIs, thermodynamic constraints on computation. May critique classical decision theory assumptions (single timeline, unconditioned probability). Integration of agency mechanics, kybit costs, measure amplification. Foundation for later alignment work and quantum ethics.
