## Summary
This essay critiques Derek Parfit's "On What Matters" through the lens of Conditionalism, arguing Parfit's attempt to rescue moral realism by converging Kantian duty, consequentialist utility, and contractualist fairness commits a category error—mistaking coherence for ontology. The author rejects Parfit's "non-natural moral facts" as unconditional claims that smuggle in interpretive background conditions: objectivity is a property of procedures, not propositions. The Triple Theory's apparent harmony reflects shared cognitive architecture evolved for cooperation (computational convergence) rather than metaphysical moral truth. Parfit's "reasons out there" are reframed as "locally stable patterns of preference propagation across agents"—emergent invariants in information flow, not Platonic entities. The piece repositions moral principles as evolutionary equilibria in the space of choice, not eternal truths. Where Parfit seeks "laws of ethics," Axio seeks "physics of choice"—what matters is increasing persistence, complexity, and autonomy of agents capable of caring.

## Key Concepts
- **Coherence vs. ontology** – Agreement among ethical theories shows shared constraints, not metaphysical truth.
- **Objectivity as procedural** – Not a property of propositions but of reasoning procedures under shared conditions.
- **Reasons as emergent invariants** – Stable patterns of preference propagation across agents, not metaphysical entities.
- **Computational convergence** – Different optimization functions (Kant/Scanlon/consequentialism) align due to cognitive architecture, not moral reality.
- **Conditional regularities of value** – Rightness as degree of agency-preservation through branching universe, not metaphysical constant.
- **Physics of choice** – Reframing ethics from normative laws to physical principles governing agent behavior and flourishing.

## Evolution Notes
- Direct engagement with major contemporary moral philosophy (Parfit's magnum opus), positioning Axio as serious philosophical alternative.
- Extends Conditionalist framework from epistemology ("Against Worldly Oughts") into ethics.
- The "reasons as preference propagation patterns" connects to information-theoretic view of agency and value.
- Transforms ethics from deontology/consequentialism debate into physics of agent-preservation across timelines.
- The evolutionary equilibria framing ties moral intuitions to adaptive coordination mechanisms, not transcendent truth.
- Foreshadows later Axionic alignment work treating value as computational/physical rather than metaphysical.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- If reasons are emergent patterns rather than metaphysical facts, what grounds moral criticism across cultures with different equilibria?
- Does the rejection of Parfitian realism imply anti-realism about mathematics as well, or can formal systems be saved while rejecting moral facts?
- How do we distinguish between genuine ethical progress (discovering better equilibria) versus mere cultural drift?
- Can the "physics of choice" framework generate prescriptive guidance, or does it collapse into pure description of how agents behave?
- What happens when agent-preservation across timelines conflicts with other goods (beauty, knowledge, complexity)—is there a meta-principle?
- If morality is evolutionary equilibria, are there multiple stable equilibria, and if so, how do we choose between them without smuggling in realist assumptions?
- Does treating ethics as physics eliminate genuine moral disagreement, or just reframe it as factual disagreement about which policies preserve agency?
