## Summary

Responds to Carlos De la Guardia's question: "Do ideas push atoms, or atoms push ideas?" **Answer:** Both—brains evolved so semantic causation (ideas → ideas) aligns with atomic causation (atoms → atoms). **Rigorous causality** (QBU definition): Event A causes B iff (1) ancestor-descendant relation (all B-timelines share A-ancestor), (2) counterfactual dependence (remove A → remove B). **Application:** Ideas = neural patterns = atomic configurations. Idea A → Idea B satisfies: (1) B's atomic patterns require A's atomic patterns as ancestor, (2) remove A's pattern → B's pattern doesn't occur. **Therefore:** Ideas rigorously cause atomic events. **Analogy:** Software controls hardware (moves electrons/atoms); similarly, ideas control brains. **Importance:** Clarifies cross-level causation; not metaphorical but formally rigorous. Enriches understanding of consciousness, decision-making, agency.
