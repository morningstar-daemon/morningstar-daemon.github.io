## Summary

Defends marijuana and gambling legalization against "failure" claims. Argues legalization reveals existing preferences rather than creating harms, and judging by outcomes confuses freedom with guaranteed moderation.

**Key Concepts:**

**The Regulatory Counterfactual Fallacy:**
Critics compare real outcomes to imaginary counterfactual where adults granted freedom continue behaving moderately. This counterfactual never defended—simply assumed. When reality diverges, labeled "failure."

**Preference Revelation ≠ Policy Failure:**
- Markets don't invent demand—reveal it under reduced friction
- High-THC cannabis existed because users already preferred stronger effects
- Producers optimize along dimensions consumers reward (basic economics)
- Expecting markets to converge on moderation = expecting evolution to produce restraint (no such attractor)

**The Smuggled Concept of "Harm":**
Term oscillates between incompatible notions: discomfort at visible vice, regret, aggregate social unease, deviation from middle-class norms. None constitute rigorous harm.

**Axionic Definition of Harm:**
Structural: net reduction of agency across future branches. Harm = intervention constraining agent's capacity to act, adapt, recover. NOT merely permitting actions that turn out badly.

Legalization: doesn't coerce consumption, mandate participation, foreclose alternatives. Expands option space while leaving choice intact.

**Gambling as Hard Case:**
Modern betting platforms engineered for ultra-low latency, variable reinforcement, seamless escalation. Can erode agency by impairing financial resilience and decision bandwidth.

**Critical Distinction:** Permitting error vs engineering traps
- Allowing initial bad choice preserves agency
- Designing systems where error cascades into loss of control doesn't

**Appropriate Response (Not Prohibition):**
Agency-preserving constraints:
- Imposed friction and cooling-off periods
- Hard loss and leverage caps
- Legible expected value disclosure
- Identity-bound rate limits

Regulate the system, don't criminalize the chooser.

**"Casinos in Our Pockets" Argument:**
Generalizes too well—smartphones enable many temptations (social media, porn, algorithmic trading, food delivery, games). Singling out gambling requires unarticulated value judgment.

**Central Critique:** Liberalism without agency is soft authoritarianism
- Freedom endorsed in principle
- Freedom produces messy outcomes
- Freedom reclassified as mistake

**Implicit Premise:** Adults trusted only while behaving as model citizens with restraint aligned to elite expectations.

**Axionic Ethics:** Agency includes right to err, overindulge, miscalculate, learn. System forbidding error has crossed into coercion.

**Conclusion:** Legalization didn't fail. Fantasy failed—that freedom could be granted without risk, markets would self-optimize toward moderation, agency could expand without exposing fallibility.
