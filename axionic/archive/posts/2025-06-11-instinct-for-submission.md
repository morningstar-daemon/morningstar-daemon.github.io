## Summary
This post explores why authoritarianism appears to be humanity's psychological default while liberalism remains a fragile cultural achievement. Six evolutionary and cognitive factors explain the instinct for submission: (1) hierarchies optimized group survival; (2) cognitive heuristics make outsourcing decisions to authority mentally efficient; (3) conformity bias and in-group favoritism are hardwired; (4) humans crave epistemic certainty over ambiguity; (5) fear weaponizes coercion effectively; (6) authoritarianism relieves the psychological burden of personal responsibility. Axio concludes that liberalism requires continuous vigilance and effort because it works *against* deeply-rooted psychological impulses favoring authoritarian submission. Individual agency is cognitively demanding and ethically costly—but necessary.

## Key Concepts
- **Evolutionary hierarchy** – Coordinated action under authority offered survival advantages; authoritarian structures are ancestrally adaptive.
- **Cognitive outsourcing** – Heuristics that delegate decisions to authorities save mental resources; autonomy is cognitively expensive.
- **Conformity bias** – Innate tendency to align with majority/authority to avoid ostracism; authoritarianism leverages this.
- **Epistemic comfort** – Humans prefer certainty over ambiguity; dogmatic narratives psychologically appeal more than conditional truths.
- **Coercion dynamics** – Fear of harm creates self-reinforcing submission; avoiding threats becomes habitual defensive strategy.
- **Responsibility trade-off** – Authoritarianism relieves individuals of agency's psychological burden by centralizing decision-making.

## Evolution Notes
- Synthesizes evolutionary psychology with Axio's agency/coercion framework.
- Explains *why* liberalism is precarious—not just *that* it is.
- Connects to earlier work on coercion, agency decay, and control work from Physics of Agency.
- Anticipates later discussions of cultural evolution, preference formation, and value stability.
- Frames political philosophy as continuous struggle against psychological defaults.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can educational or cultural interventions counteract these psychological defaults?
- Are there evolutionary contexts where autonomy would have been adaptively advantageous?
- How do we design institutions that work *with* rather than against human psychology while preserving liberal values?
- Is the cognitive burden of agency reducible through better tools, norms, or social technologies?
