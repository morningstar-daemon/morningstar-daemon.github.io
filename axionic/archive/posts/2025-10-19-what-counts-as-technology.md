## Summary
This essay provides an ontological definition of technology: "a realized functional pattern that originated in an intentional mind." It distinguishes formations (natural patterns like crystals, DNA, galaxies) from artifacts (mind-originated patterns), further dividing artifacts by telos into instrumental (operating outward on world/matter/behavior) and expressive (operating inward on perception/meaning/emotion). Technology uses instrumental telos, art uses expressive telos. The piece argues that expression is itself instrumental but operates semantically rather than physically—"a song changes emotional state; a speech reshapes beliefs." Both technology and art are artifacts that "reduce uncertainty, one about how to act, the other about what it means." The taxonomy: Realized Pattern → Formation (natural) / Artifact (mind-born) → Technology (instrumental) / Art (expressive). Technology is "thought made persistent—patterns stabilized beyond the mind that conceived them."

## Key Concepts
- **Technology as mind-realized pattern** – Not tools/machines but intentionally conceived functional patterns instantiated in the world.
- **Formation vs. artifact** – Natural emergence vs. mental ancestry as fundamental ontological divide.
- **Instrumental vs. expressive telos** – Operating on world-states vs. operating on interpretive states.
- **Expression as semantic instrumentality** – Art is technology of experience, optimizing for resonance rather than control.
- **Uncertainty reduction** – Both technology and art reduce uncertainty, one about action, one about meaning.
- **Externalized hypothesis** – Every artifact as stabilized proposition about how world can be made to behave.

## Evolution Notes
- Characteristic Axio move: providing precise ontological definitions for contested concepts.
- The taxonomy echoes broader Axio interest in clean categorical frameworks and foundational distinctions.
- Positions art and technology as sibling categories rather than opposites or hierarchy.
- The "thought made persistent" formulation connects to themes of agency, intentionality, and embodied cognition.
- Foreshadows later discussions of AI as technology versus mind, tool versus agent.
- The semantic/physical instrumentality distinction parallels earlier work on language as causal medium.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Does this definition adequately handle emergent technologies (evolved rather than designed)—genetic algorithms, self-organizing systems?
- What about technologies discovered accidentally (penicillin) or natural patterns co-opted (beavers' dams mimicked)?
- How do we classify hybrid cases like bioengineered organisms—are they formations, artifacts, or a third category?
- Does the framework apply to social technologies (marriage, money, law) or only physical/informational ones?
- If AI systems create artifacts, do those count as technology (mind-originated) even if the mind is synthetic?
- What about tools created by animals (chimps using sticks)—does non-human intentionality count?
- Is the formation/artifact distinction absolute or does it admit degrees (domesticated plants, trained animals)?
