## Summary

Quantifies personal identity across QBU branches. **Phenotype stability:** Genotype diverges rapidly (near-zero measure); phenotype persists robustly (developmental redundancy). **Timeline count:** ~10^(10^9) timelines ("Gigaplex") with recognizable phenotype over 80 years (2.5×10^9 quantum events). **Measure vs Count:** Exponential branching creates vast timeline count, but total Measure = 1 (distributed across branches). **Extreme longevity scenarios:** (1) No tech: Measure ~0 for >120 years. (2) Moderate tech: Measure ~10^(-5) to 10^(-10) for 200-300 years. (3) Radical tech (singularity): Measure ~10^(-2) for 10,000+ years (1% chance breakthrough × 99.9999% yearly survival). **Insight:** Extended lifespans plausible given technological breakthroughs, but not guaranteed—measure matters more than timeline count.
