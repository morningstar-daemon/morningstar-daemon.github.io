## Summary

Defends the "believers should grow up" critique as developmentally accurate using Robert Kegan's stages of adult development. Most adults remain at Stage 3 (Socialized Mind)—defined by conformity, sustained by belonging, moral sense derivative. Stage 4 (Self-Authoring Mind) means internalizing judgment tools and building own moral calculus. Stage 5 (Self-Transforming Mind) treats even self-authored framework as subject of reflection. Religions/ideologies conspire to keep people at Stage 3 (certainty, purpose, belonging) at cost of intellectual independence. To "grow up" = reconstruct morality, trade comfort for coherence.

## Key Concepts

**Robert Kegan's Stages (Applied):**

**Stage 3: Socialized Mind**
- Defined by conformity
- Sustained by belonging
- Bounded by shared norms
- Moral sense derivative: "good because others expect it"
- Live by imitation, not authorship
- **Where most adults remain**

**Stage 4: Self-Authoring Mind**
- "Crossing developmental Rubicon"
- Internalizing tools of judgment
- Building own moral calculus
- No longer borrow coherence from tribe/scripture—construct it
- Can critique culture without losing compass (compass forged, not inherited)
- Don't parrot decency—reason it

**Stage 5: Self-Transforming Mind**
- Even self-authored framework becomes subject of reflection
- Identity fluid but not unprincipled
- Coherence itself = evolving project
- Hold multiple systems in tension
- Each recognized as lens rather than law

**The Conspiracy:**
"Religions, ideologies, and corporate cultures all conspire—perhaps unwittingly—to keep people at Stage 3."

- Offer certainty, purpose, belonging
- Cost: intellectual independence
- Institutions reward obedience over originality (obedience scales)
- Growth metabolically expensive

**The Reframe:**
"To 'grow up' in this sense is not to discard morality but to reconstruct it."
- Trade comfort for coherence
- Validation for integrity
- Enlightened heretic doesn't reject decency—re-authors it

**Better Version of Taunt:**
"Faith is how we first borrow morality; maturity is how we later earn it."

**Final:** "Maturity is not the death of belief; it is the ongoing act of re-creating it—transforming values from inheritance into intention."

## Relation to Axio Framework

- **Sagency:** self-authoring agency
- **Coherence:** building consistent internal models vs borrowing from tribe
- **Against Faith:** moving from uncalibrated belief to reasoned conviction
- **Agency:** developmental trajectory toward reflective autonomy
- **Phosphorism:** illuminating own path vs following prescribed one

Connects developmental psychology to epistemic virtue. Growing up = becoming epistemically mature.

## Style Note

Concise, uses Kegan's framework as backbone. Charitable to religious function (Stage 3 serves purpose) while arguing for transcendence. Ends with reconciliation: not death of belief but transformation.
