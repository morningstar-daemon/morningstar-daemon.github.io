## Summary
Secular meta-myth: Universe's story as grand narrative from chaos → matter → life → consciousness → meaning. Alternative to religious cosmology providing sense of purpose/direction without supernatural claims. Core insight: Meaning emerges through complexification and agency evolution; narrative coherence without metaphysical baggage.
