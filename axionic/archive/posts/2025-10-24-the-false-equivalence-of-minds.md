# The False Equivalence of Minds

## Summary
Challenges notion that computational universality implies practical equality of minds. Turing-complete systems theoretically equivalent, but practical differences vast (speed, memory, architecture). Core insight: Universality doesn't mean equal capability; implementation details determine actual performance. Abstract equivalence ≠ practical equality.
