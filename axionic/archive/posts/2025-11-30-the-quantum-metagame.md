## Summary
This post establishes the deepest layer of the Metagame Sequence by reconceptualizing persistence under Everettian quantum mechanics. Classical survival assumes a single linear future, but reality branches through decoherence, creating multiple quasi-classical histories. Patterns persist not by surviving in one timeline but by maintaining structural coherence across amplitude-weighted branches. Measure—the squared amplitude of branches—becomes the scoreboard of the quantum metagame, and agency transforms from "choosing which future" to "choosing which pattern to instantiate across futures." This reframes meaning, ethics, and value as competitions for coherence under branching reality.

## Key Concepts
- **Branch structure** – Reality continuously decoheres into distinct quasi-classical histories; persistence means survival across branches, not within one.
- **Measure as scoreboard** – Amplitude-weighted prevalence of pattern versions across branches; high-measure patterns dominate future influence.
- **Decoherence as fitness landscape** – Physical process that carves wavefunction into branches, creating the terrain where patterns compete.
- **Agency as measure constructor** – Shaping which pattern versions remain coherent across branches, not which single branch "you" enter.
- **Quantum pattern dynamics** – Drift (branch divergence), lock (stable attractors across branches), collapse (measure loss).

## Evolution Notes
- Provides quantum mechanical foundation for all strategic analysis in Axio framework.
- Shows how classical notions of survival, meaning, and ethics are surface phenomena of deeper quantum dynamics.
- Dissolves nihilistic confusion: if all branches exist, choices matter *more* because they shape amplitude-weighted continuity.

## Open Questions
- Can we develop empirical tests that distinguish quantum measure effects from classical probability?
- How does conscious experience relate to branch weight—does subjective probability track measure?
- What practical decision-making heuristics follow from quantum metagame awareness?
