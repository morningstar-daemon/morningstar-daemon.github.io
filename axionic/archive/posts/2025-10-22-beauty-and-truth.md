# Beauty and Truth

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Batch:** Batch 24 (Posts 1–25)

## Summary
Examines aesthetic epistemology—using beauty as truth indicator. Limitations: beauty reflects elegance/simplicity, not necessarily correctness. Ugly truths exist; beautiful falsehoods proliferate. Core insight: Aesthetic appeal useful heuristic but unreliable arbiter; empirical verification required regardless of elegance.
