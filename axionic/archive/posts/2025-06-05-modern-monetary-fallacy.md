## Summary

Comprehensive critique of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) from axionic/libertarian perspective. Argues MMT fundamentally misunderstands currency as neutral coordination technology.

**Key Concepts:**

**MMT's Core Claims:**
- Sovereign currency issuers can print without constraint
- Only inflation limits spending
- Taxation creates demand for currency (behavioral lever)

**Axionic Critique:**

**1. Currency as Neutral Medium:**
- Currency communicates subjective valuations between individuals
- Utility from fungibility, acceptance, ease of quantification
- MMT wrongly imbues currency with intrinsic governmental authority

**2. Hidden Conditions (Conditionalism):**
- MMT assumes public trust, political stability, productive capacity
- These conditions are fragile; erosion causes rapid currency collapse

**3. Agency Violation:**
- Taxation as behavioral lever = coercion
- Erodes voluntary action and individual choice
- Imposes valuations by force vs facilitating free expression

**4. Knowledge Problem (Hayek):**
- Centralized fiscal/monetary decisions assume impossible information perfection
- History shows centralization yields misallocations and stagnation

**5. Historical Evidence:**
- Weimar Germany, Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Argentina
- Unchecked fiat expansion consistently causes devastation

**Central Argument:** Currency functions exclusively as neutral translator of subjective valuations. MMT misunderstands this neutrality, ignores conditional dependencies, disregards agency, and dismisses historical evidence.
