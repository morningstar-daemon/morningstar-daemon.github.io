## Summary

Argues that **recursive justification of choices bottoms out in aesthetics**, not logic or ethics. When asking "why?" repeatedly, instrumental reasons (do X for Y) eventually terminate at **non-instrumental values chosen for themselves**. Aesthetics—the felt sense of rightness, coherence, elegance—provides terminal anchor. This isn't arbitrary but **condition of agency itself**: without endpoint, justification is infinite regress. **Root values cannot be justified; they can only be revealed, refined, and lived.** Connects to Phosphorism: vitality, intelligence, complexity, flourishing, authenticity valued aesthetically, not instrumentally.

## Key Concepts
- **Recursive justification** – Asking "why?" until instrumental reasons exhaust
- **Aesthetics as terminal attractor** – Felt sense of rightness grounding choice
- **Non-instrumental values** – Chosen for themselves, not further outcomes
- **Phosphorism connection** – Core values shine with intrinsic luminosity
- **Inescapable circularity** – Root values ground all choice but cannot themselves be grounded
