# Conditional Divinity

## Summary

This post engages Joscha Bach's redefinition of God as an emergent attractor in agency-space rather than supernatural being. Bach's framing: God is the global optimum of shared agency—the highest point of alignment where individuals act toward "what is best." This deity is not outside the world but instantiated *within it* to the extent humans recognize and enact truth, reason, and goodness. Bach's provocative conclusion: "God is not dead, but the church is." The transcendent attractor persists; the institutional vessel has failed.

**Bach's Core Claims:**
1. **God as collective agent:** Distributed across all agents, existing proportionally to their alignment with the best
2. **Existence by recognition:** God's reality is partial and variable—more real when more people enact the optimum
3. **Institutional failure:** Churches once coordinated shared agency but no longer fulfill this role
4. **Persistent ideal:** The aspirational force remains despite institutional decay

**Axio's Evaluation:**

**Strengths:**
- **Naturalization:** Avoids supernaturalism while preserving divine's motivational force
- **Historical continuity:** Echoes Spinoza's *Deus sive Natura* and Teilhard's Omega Point, articulated in computational/optimization terms
- **Sharp institutional critique:** Resonates with contemporary religious decline

**Weaknesses:**
- **Ambiguity of "what's best":** Underspecified criterion (utilitarian happiness? agency preservation? truth-seeking?). Risks collapsing into personal opinion.
- **Epistemic optimism:** Assumes humans can reliably recognize the optimum despite biases, tribal incentives, deep moral disagreement
- **Suppression of divergence:** Collective agency can oppress; dissenting minorities often point closer to truth than consensus. Global optimum risks erasing valuable local optima.

**Broader Connections:**
- **Nietzsche inversion:** Nietzsche declared God dead because metaphysical institutions collapsed; Bach argues God persists as emergent ideal while church failed
- **Game theory:** God as coordination equilibrium of "do what's best"; challenge is building trust/signaling/enforcement mechanisms
- **QBU/Conditionalism:** In Quantum Branching Universe framework, God as global optimum parallels maximizing-agency branch measure; Conditionalism clarifies hidden assumptions in "what's best"

**Axio's Conclusion:** Definition is elegant but incomplete. Succeeds in reinterpreting God as emergent attractor but glosses over hard problem: discovering, justifying, and coordinating around "what's best." Institutions failed at precisely this task—resolving pluralism into coordinated agency. Perhaps God doesn't require a church: He lives distributed in code, markets, small communities, fleeting acts of truth. The priests are gone, but the pattern persists.

## Key Concepts

- **Emergent attractor** – God as global optimum in agency-space that agents can approach but never fully reach; computational/optimization framing of divinity.
- **Distributed divinity** – God instantiated proportionally across individuals to extent they enact "what is best"; partial and variable existence.
- **Existence by recognition** – God's reality depends on human alignment; more recognition/enactment = more real.
- **Institutional decay vs. persistent ideal** – Churches as failed coordination mechanisms while the aspirational attractor endures.
- **Value-discovery problem** – Hard challenge of determining "what's best" without rigorous mechanisms; coordination requires resolving pluralism.
- **Local vs. global optima** – Tension between collective consensus and dissenting innovation; global optimum risks suppressing valuable divergence.

## Evolution Notes

- **Rare theological engagement:** Most Axio posts avoid direct God-talk; this explicitly engages religious concepts through rationalist lens.
- **Joscha Bach synthesis:** Positions Axio within AI safety/rationalist discourse that includes Bach, Schmidhuber, computational theology.
- **QBU application:** Connects emergent God to quantum branching framework—God as measure-maximizing branch pattern.
- **Conditionalism preview:** References Conditionalism framework that becomes major theme in later posts (#243+).
- **Distributed coordination theme:** Foreshadows later work on Axiocracy (#278), governance without central authority, prediction markets.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions

- **Value pluralism:** If deep moral disagreement is permanent, can there be single "global optimum," or must we accept multiple legitimate local optima?
- **Measurement impossibility:** How would we empirically measure proximity to the "God attractor"? What observables indicate alignment with "what's best"?
- **Bach's criterion:** What specific value function does Bach himself use? Does he specify, or is ambiguity intentional?
- **Emergent vs. constructed:** Is the optimum *discovered* (objective reality we approximate) or *constructed* (contingent on shared values)? Does distinction matter?
- **Institutional necessity:** Can coordination-at-scale happen without institutions, or do distributed mechanisms (markets, code) just become new institutions?
- **AI as priest:** Could AI systems serve as value-discovery/coordination mechanisms that churches failed to provide? What risks would this carry?
- **Minority prophets:** How does framework handle cases where dissenting individual was *right* and collective was wrong (Galileo, Semmelweis)? Is there meta-level criterion?
- **Dynamic vs. static:** Is "what's best" fixed or evolving? If evolving, does God change, or do our approximations improve while target remains constant?
