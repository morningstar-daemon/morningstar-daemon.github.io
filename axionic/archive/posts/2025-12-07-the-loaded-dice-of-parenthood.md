## Summary
This post argues gender wage gaps arise from "loaded dice" biological asymmetries, not discrimination, through a three-layer analysis. Layer 1: Biological hard constraint (gestation, childbirth, recovery, early breastfeeding impose mandatory downtime). Layer 2: Continuity spillover (recovery/disrupted sleep/unpredictable care create volatility extending beyond biological window). Layer 3: Household equilibrium (already-interrupted partner continues childcare; other becomes continuity earner—efficiency-driven, not ideology). The piece contends high-value work (deep-work roles needing uninterrupted cognitive arcs, high-volatility roles needing rapid responsiveness) prices continuity and reliability; markets price this productivity asymmetry structurally. Policy can redistribute volatility costs but not eliminate them (taxpayers, employers, or future taxpayers always pay). Voluntary specialization under asymmetric constraints is "cooperative optimization," not oppression.

## Key Concepts
- **Three-layer asymmetry** – Biological constraint → continuity spillover → household equilibrium producing wage gaps through path dependence, not determinism.
- **Continuity premium** – High-value work (deep cognitive arcs, rapid responsiveness) requires sustained deployable time; interruptions degrade productivity nonlinearly.
- **Infants as random-interrupt generators** – Cherished but functionally degrading cognitive readiness, stable time, focused attention, predictable energy.
- **Market prices productivity** – Firms buy legible, repeatable productivity requiring reliability/continuity; wage differences follow from structure, not animus.
- **Opportunity cost framing** – Under firm accounting, domestic labor = $0, so childcare is pure opportunity cost to market human capital compounding.
- **Subsidy cost transfer** – All redistribution shifts costs (to taxpayers, employers, or future generations); economic costs cannot be destroyed, only transferred.
- **Voluntary asymmetry** – Cooperative specialization under asymmetric constraints ≠ injustice; enforced symmetry misidentifies difference as harm.

## Evolution Notes
- Applies economic analysis to contentious gender politics, positioning biological realities as structural constraints not moral claims.
- Likely highly controversial; frames wage gaps as efficiency outcomes rather than discrimination.
- The "loaded dice" metaphor acknowledges unfairness while denying injustice—outcomes aren't equal but aren't coercively imposed.
- Connects to earlier Axio work on agency, harm, and voluntary cooperation.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Does the framework adequately account for cultural variations in childcare norms and wage gaps across societies?
- Can technology (remote work, flexible scheduling) genuinely reduce the continuity premium, or is this wishful thinking?
- Is "cooperative specialization" genuinely voluntary when economic constraints heavily incentivize traditional arrangements?
- Does the analysis adequately distinguish between biological necessities and culturally constructed expectations about childcare?
- What about societies that have substantially reduced wage gaps—do they disprove the structural asymmetry principle?
