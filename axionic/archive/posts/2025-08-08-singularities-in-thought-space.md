## Summary

Uses Joscha Bach's black hole metaphor: ideologies as singularities in thought space, consuming nuance and extinguishing dissent. Gravity well of belief strengthens through confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, in-group approval. Event horizon: frame dictates permissible reasoning; disconfirming evidence contorted or discarded. Singularity: absolute compression—complexity → single totalizing explanation, cognitive dissonance annihilated. Escape requires rupture (catastrophe, alien worldview exposure, self-scrutiny). Navigator's task: chart gravity wells, detect curvatures, resist immunity conceit.

**Mechanics:**
- Proximity strengthens pull (confirmation bias)
- Event horizon: operating entirely within frame
- Singularity: infinite density, absolute certainty
- Warps discourse landscape (even for opponents)

**Escape:** Rarely through polite deliberation; requires forces stronger than ideology itself.
