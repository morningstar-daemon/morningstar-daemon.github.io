## Summary

**Precise operational definition of consent.** Foundational in ethics, law, medicine, sex, governance—often treated loosely/simplistically. **Definition**: Consent = uncoerced, informed, intentional agreement by agent to proposed action/condition. **Five elements**: (1) **Agent** (decision-capable—adult YES, five-year-old NO, unconscious person NO). (2) **Intentional** (deliberate decision—explicit "yes" YES, distracted mumble NO, silence inferred NO). (3) **Informed** (understand nature/scope/consequences—full surgical disclosure YES, hidden audio recording NO, unread 60-page TOS NO). (4) **Uncoerced** (not extracted under threat—volunteer with no refusal consequences YES, "sign or we'll fire you" NO, detainee under increased charges threat NO). (5) **Revocable (contextual)** (in ongoing participation contexts like sex/research—study participant withdraws YES, "you already agreed, can't back out" NO). **Composite example**: Competent adult, full documentation + verbal clarification, signs research form, can opt out anytime, no refusal consequences = true consent. **Why matters**: Clear definitions prevent confusion between agreement and submission, volition and pressure, compliance and autonomy. Critical for law, medicine, relationships, governance. Without clear consent understanding, rights collapse into rituals, contracts become domination tools.
