# The Metagame of Incentives

**Date:** November 26, 2025  
**Batch:** Batch 27 (Posts 076–100)

## Summary
This post examines incentives as the transmission mechanism by which higher-level games shape lower-level ones without altering formal rules. Axios defines incentives not as simple carrots/sticks but as "consequence structures that make one strategy more attractive than another to an agent trying to win a higher-level game." The piece traces how incentive gradients propagate downward (funding prioritizes novelty → journals prioritize novelty → scientists chase novelty → replication collapses), connecting to the ultimate metagame of persistence that shapes all lower games through survival, stability, and resource-competition pressures. The post positions understanding incentives as central to agency: "Agency is not merely choosing actions. Agency is choosing which incentives you allow to govern your actions."

## Key Concepts
- **Incentives as differential advantage** – Not rewards per se, but consequence structures that make certain strategies more attractive for winning higher-level games.
- **Effective vs. formal rules** – Incentives define effective rules (what actually matters) even when formal rules remain unchanged.
- **Downward propagation** – How higher-level incentives reach into lower games to rewrite strategic landscapes (funding→journals→scientists→replication collapse pattern).
- **Incentive scaling** – The mechanism by which local incentive structures replicate and amplify across system levels.
- **Ultimate metagame transmission** – Persistence pressures create survival/stability/competition incentives that propagate through all game layers.
- **Agency as incentive selection** – The reframing of agency as choosing which incentives govern your actions, not just choosing actions.

## Evolution Notes
- Direct continuation of "Games and Metagames" framework, focusing specifically on incentive mechanics.
- Connects metagame theory to the "ultimate metagame" (persistence) that will be explored in post 87.
- The examples (science replication crisis, social media outrage, political theater) ground abstract theory in recognizable pathologies.
- Sets up conceptual machinery for understanding systemic dysfunction as incentive-driven rather than individual moral failure.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can agents ever fully escape inherited incentive structures, or are they always shaped by them?
- What distinguishes "choosing which incentives govern you" from mere rationalization of existing incentive capture?
- How do incentive structures emerge at each level—are they designed, evolved, or both?
- Can understanding incentives enable redesign of pathological systems, or does that understanding itself become captured by higher-level incentives?
