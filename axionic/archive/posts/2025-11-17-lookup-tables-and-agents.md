## Core Question

**When is a lookup table an adequate model of an agent's behavior, and what does this reveal about the architecture of agency?**

Clarifies distinction between understanding, control, and belief by examining agents whose behavior can be captured by simple condition-action mappings.

## Lookup Table Definition

**Fixed mapping:** Discrete conditions → corresponding actions
- **No abstraction or compression**
- Simply specifies which response associated with which observed state
- Minimal internal model

## The Sphex Wasp: Minimal Controller

### Behavior Pattern

**Nest provisioning sequence:**
1. Drag paralyzed cricket to burrow entrance
2. Leave cricket outside
3. Enter nest to inspect
4. Retrieve cricket

**Rigid invariance:**
- If cricket moved during inspection → **repeats entire sequence**
- **No contextual integration**
- **No internal state maintenance**
- Can loop indefinitely

### As Lookup Table

**Condition-action mappings:**
- IF prey near threshold → drag to threshold
- IF prey at threshold AND nest uninspected → enter nest
- IF nest inspected → retrieve prey

**Minimal state-transition table:**
- No internal representation of prey/environment/task required beyond mapping
- Coherent within ecological niche
- Natural selection optimized for specific environment

> "The wasp's behavior is coherent within the ecological niche in which it evolved, and natural selection has furnished a controller that satisfies the demands of that environment without requiring a general model of it."

## Biological Examples of Lookup Tables

### 1. Bacterial Chemotaxis
- Chemical concentration changes → motor behavior
- Simple gradient following
- No cognitive representation

### 2. Fixed-Action Patterns (Birds/Fish)
- Simple stimulus conditions trigger behaviors
- Stereotyped responses
- Minimal state tracking

### 3. Plant Tropisms
- Local chemical gradients → differential growth
- Distributed sensing
- No centralized model

**Common features:**
- Environment supplies limited, well-structured cues
- Behavior depends on small number of disjunctions
- Natural selection optimizes mappings without requiring cognitive internal model

## When Lookup Tables Suffice

### Adequate Conditions

**Lookup table works when:**
1. **Relevant state space is small:** Few possible states
2. **Environment is stable:** Regularities persist
3. **Behavioral repertoire is rigid:** Fixed responses optimal
4. **Distinctions few:** Limited relevant variables

**Result:** Controller reliably succeeds encoding only necessary distinctions

**No need for:**
- Rich internal models
- Flexible reasoning
- Counterfactual evaluation
- Long-horizon planning

## When Lookup Tables Fail

### Limitations in Complex Environments

**Cannot:**
- Integrate information across time
- Evaluate unexperienced contingencies
- Adapt to novel contexts
- Revise strategies in response to unexpected dynamics

### Require Richer Models

**Examples needing more:**
- Human cognition
- Markets
- Political institutions
- Complex ecosystems

**Reason:** Non-trivial structure cannot be captured by finite rule tables

**Alternative:** Controllers that construct/update internal models reflecting underlying causal relations

## Cybernetic Distinction: Models Without Beliefs

### Good Regulator Theorem Application

**Theorem:** Any reliable regulator must embody model of regulated system

**For simple organisms:**
- Model may reduce to lookup table
- **Table IS a model:** Functionally preserves distinctions necessary for action
- Structural correspondence sufficient

### Models ≠ Beliefs

**Key distinction:**
- **Belief:** Concept from intentional stance (observer attribution)
- **Model:** Structural encoding of distinctions
- **Lookup-table controller:** Can regulate without propositional attitudes

**Implication:** Internal model is **structural rather than conceptual**

> "A lookup-table controller can regulate a process without instantiating anything resembling a propositional attitude."

## Gradient of Agency

### Lower Bound: Lookup Tables
- Minimal model-based behavior
- Regulate effectively in limited, structured environments
- Few and fixed relevant distinctions
- No beliefs or intentions

### Higher Complexity: Rich Models
- Complex environments require richer internal models
- Support prediction, adaptation, intentional action
- Counterfactual reasoning
- Temporal integration

### Continuum
```
Lookup Table → Fixed-Action Patterns → Reactive Behaviors → 
Model-Based Control → Flexible Agency → Intentional Systems
```

## Implications for Artificial Systems

### Simple Embedded Controllers
- Resemble biological lookup tables
- Effective in narrow domains
- Low modeling burden
- No need for sophisticated representations

### Large Language Models
- **Cannot be captured by finite rule set**
- Flexible generative behavior
- Internal representations support generalization
- **Different category of model**
- Beyond experienced data

### Design Insight
Understanding lookup-table sufficiency clarifies:
- When to use simple controllers (narrow, stable domains)
- When to invest in rich models (complex, variable environments)
- Architecture of agency gradient

## Philosophical Implications

### For Philosophy of Mind
- **Behavior ≠ mind:** Lookup tables regulate without beliefs
- **Intentional stance:** Observer attribution (not intrinsic property)
- **Structural vs. conceptual models:** Different kinds of representation
- **Agency gradient:** Not binary (has/lacks)

### For Cognitive Science
- **Minimal cognition exists:** Lookup tables are edge case
- **Representation necessary:** Even simple controllers model
- **Flexibility distinguishes:** Rich models from simple mappings
- **Evolution optimizes:** To environmental demands (not general intelligence)

### For AI Ethics
- **Simple controllers:** No moral status (no beliefs/intentions)
- **Complex models:** Gradual emergence of morally relevant properties
- **LLMs:** Unclear position on gradient
- **Design choices matter:** Model richness affects moral considerations
