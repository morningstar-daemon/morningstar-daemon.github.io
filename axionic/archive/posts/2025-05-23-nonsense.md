## Summary

Technical definition of **nonsense**: utterance lacking interpretability within *any* coherent semantic/syntactic framework under maximally charitable interpretation (no determinate meaning, reference, or truth conditions). Formally: proposition P is nonsense if no interpretation I assigns truth value. Applies definition to four disciplines: **Theology** (timeless yet acts = contradiction), **Queer Theory** (deliberate semantic destabilization), **Astrology** (category mistakes), **Homeopathy** (water memory = chemically incoherent). **Contrasts** with meaningful claims (water boils at 100°C, QBU branching). Aligns with Conditionalism (truth requires coherent context). Polemic but technically precise—draws line between meaningful discourse and semantic void. Cites logical positivism (Carnap), Popper, Quine, Sokal.
