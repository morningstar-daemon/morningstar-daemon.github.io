## Summary

Critique of AI doomerism slogan "If anyone builds it, everyone dies." Argues this framing is counterproductive: creates inevitability mindset, discourages safety work, and obscures coordination problems. Alternative framing: ASI is high-variance outcome space where safety research, governance design, and coordination mechanisms matter enormously. Not binary (doom/utopia) but spectrum shaped by choices. Rejects both naive optimism and fatalistic pessimism for constructive agency-preserving approach.

## Key Concepts

- **Binary doom framing** – "If built, everyone dies" creates fatalism and discourages engagement
- **High-variance outcome space** – ASI future spans wide possibility range; not predetermined
- **Coordination-solvable risk** – Challenge is governance/alignment, not inherent impossibility
- **Agency preservation** – Framing should empower action, not paralyze
