## Summary
This post synthesizes three classical theories of truth—correspondence, coherence, pragmatism—into an integrated hierarchical framework rather than treating them as competing alternatives. **Central thesis:** We pursue truth for pragmatic reasons (effective agency, successful action); pragmatic utility fundamentally depends on correspondence (accurate map-to-territory relationship); and correspondence is practically evaluated through coherence (logical consistency, explanatory power). Each level serves a distinct function: **pragmatism** (purpose/top level)—why truth matters; **correspondence** (foundation/middle level)—what makes pragmatism reliable; **coherence** (method/bottom level)—how we assess correspondence indirectly since direct reality access is impossible. Medicine illustrates: pragmatic goal (health), correspondence foundation (theories match biology), coherence methodology (trials, peer review, consistent outcomes). Conditionalism supports this by emphasizing all truth claims are conditional upon interpretative frameworks. This hierarchy preserves each theory's strengths while avoiding their individual weaknesses.

## Key Concepts
- **Pragmatic imperative** – Truth valued because accurate beliefs enable effective agency and successful action.
- **Correspondence foundation** – Pragmatic success requires beliefs accurately representing external reality (map-to-territory).
- **Coherence methodology** – We assess correspondence indirectly via logical consistency, explanatory power, absence of contradiction.
- **Hierarchical integration** – Three theories complementary, not competing; each occupies distinct epistemic level.
- **Indirect access problem** – Never directly apprehend unmediated reality; coherence operationalizes correspondence assessment.
- **Conditionalist support** – All truth conditional upon interpretative frameworks; coherence itself conditional on shared assumptions.

## Evolution Notes
- Major epistemological synthesis tying together multiple philosophical traditions.
- Connects to Bayesian epistemology, Conditionalism, agent-binding subjectivism from earlier work.
- Provides meta-framework for Axio's entire knowledge-building project.
- Medicine example shows practical application beyond pure philosophy.
- Later work will reference this hierarchy when discussing scientific method, institutional epistemology, expertise.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can this hierarchy accommodate non-Western epistemologies (Buddhist logic, African ubuntu philosophy)?
- What happens when coherent systems correspond to different aspects of reality (quantum vs. classical physics)?
- Is there a fourth level needed for inter-subjective agreement or social epistemology?
- How do we resolve cases where multiple coherent frameworks make different pragmatic predictions?
