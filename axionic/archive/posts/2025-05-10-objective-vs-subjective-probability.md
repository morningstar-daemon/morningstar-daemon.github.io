## Summary

*[Note: Content reconstructed from cross-references]*

Distinguishes objective probability (quantum measure in QBU—proportion of branches where event occurs) from subjective probability (agent's credence—epistemic uncertainty given knowledge/evidence). Objective exists ontologically independent of observers but often inaccessible. Subjective guides decisions despite unknowable objective values. Framework integrates quantum mechanics (objective branching measure) with Bayesian epistemology (rational credence updating). Essential for interpreting P(doom), quantum ethics, decision theory throughout axionic philosophy.
