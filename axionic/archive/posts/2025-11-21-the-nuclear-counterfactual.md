# The Nuclear Counterfactual

**Date:** 2025-11-21  

## Summary

Quantifies costs of abandoning nuclear power in US (1965-1975). Estimates ~$25-50 trillion aggregate loss across mortality, climate, energy economics, geopolitics, and industrial capacity.

**Key Concepts:**

**Historical Context:**
1965-1975: US scaling nuclear rapidly. Two forces collided:
- Public fear (Three Mile Island)
- Environmental movement defining itself as anti-nuclear

Result: Plants cancelled, supply chains withered, regulatory timelines exploded

**Counterfactual Premise (Modest):**
Environmental movement campaigns FOR nuclear (cleaner air, climate stability, energy independence) rather than against. No fantasy 100% nuclear—just political support vs obstruction.

**Quantified Costs:**

**1. Mortality (~$15T):**
- ~37,500 TWh fossil displaced (30% of 125,000 TWh total)
- ~1.5M premature deaths avoided (air pollution)
- Value of statistical life: $10M
- Conservative total: $15 trillion

**2. Climate (~$2.6T):**
- ~26 gigatons CO₂ avoided
- Social cost of carbon: $50-200/ton
- Range: $1.3-5.2 trillion

**3. Energy Economics (~$2.25T):**
- Lower long-term costs, reduced gas dependence
- Less vulnerability to price shocks
- ~10% savings on $450B annual expenditure over 50 years

**4. Geopolitics (~$2T):**
- Less dependence on volatile oil markets
- Reduced need to stabilize petrostates
- Avoided strategic/military costs

**5. Industrial Capacity (~$3T):**
- Lost global reactor exports
- Foregone fuel cycle supply chain
- Manufacturing, IP, corporate infrastructure
- Russia, China, South Korea now dominate

**Aggregate: ~$25T (conservative), $35-50T (realistic range)**

**Conclusion:** Not technological constraint—interpretive failure. Narrative framing error cascaded through policy, economics, culture. History's branchings hinge on whether society's conceptual filters amplify coherence or suppress it.
