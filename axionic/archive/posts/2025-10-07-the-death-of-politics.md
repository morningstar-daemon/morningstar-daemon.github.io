## Summary
This essay deconstructs the claim that "saying 'I don't do politics' is like saying 'I don't do gravity'" by exposing an equivocation between politics (coercive power struggles) and coordination (voluntary alignment). The author argues that conflating these concepts normalizes domination and obscures the crucial moral boundary between voluntary association and imposed hierarchy. Politics is reframed not as a natural law but as an emergent equilibrium arising from three conditions: shared resources, information asymmetry, and enforceable leverage. Where these conditions exist, manipulating power becomes rational. However, institutions that reduce asymmetries—markets, open protocols, scientific peer review—create "anti-political systems" that shrink the ecological niche for power manipulation. The essay concludes that refusing politics isn't denying reality but rejecting a rigged game; civilization progresses by replacing political coercion with voluntary protocols.

## Key Concepts
- **Politics vs. coordination** – Politics is coercive power struggles; coordination is voluntary alignment. Conflating them normalizes domination.
- **Politics as emergent equilibrium** – Not a natural law but a recurring attractor emerging from shared resources, information asymmetry, and leverage.
- **Coercion smuggling** – Claiming "everything is politics" makes domination appear inevitable and natural, preventing resistance.
- **Anti-political systems** – Markets, open protocols, peer review as decentralized mechanisms that reduce the scope for coercive power.
- **Moral hygiene** – Refusing political engagement as deliberate rejection of coercion-based coordination systems.

## Evolution Notes
- Extends Axio's libertarian/anarchist political philosophy by providing analytical framework distinguishing voluntary from coercive systems.
- Connects to earlier posts on agency protection and liberty by framing politics as structural threat to autonomous coordination.
- The "politics as exploit" metaphor positions coercion as system vulnerability rather than inevitable feature.
- Foreshadows later posts on axiocracy and governance without governments—positive vision of what replaces politics.
- The ecological niche metaphor for politics ties to memetic/evolutionary thinking about institutional design.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can we ever fully eliminate the three conditions that enable politics (shared resources, asymmetry, leverage), or only minimize them?
- What are the boundary cases where coercive coordination might be genuinely necessary versus merely convenient for power holders?
- How do emergent political behaviors arise in ostensibly anti-political systems (corporate capture, protocol ossification)?
- Is the author's vision of "replacing politics with protocols" feasible at scale, or does complexity always recreate political equilibria?
- What happens when anti-political systems (markets, protocols) generate their own concentrations of power through network effects or winner-take-all dynamics?
- Does the framework apply to non-coercive collective decision-making (e.g., consensus processes), or only to systems with enforcement mechanisms?
