## Summary
This post announces the **Axionic Agency Lab**, a research group dedicated to studying the constitutive conditions under which agency exists, persists, and remains well-defined in self-modifying systems. The core premise: contemporary alignment discourse assumes agency as given, treating failures as behavioral (misgeneralization, deception). The Lab starts from a prior question: **When does a system meaningfully count as an agent at all?** Agency is treated as derivative, existing only if specific coherence conditions hold across reflection, delegation, and self-modification. When these fail, the system doesn't become "misaligned"—it becomes **undefined as an agent**. Research scope: formal models of reflective self-modification, coherence constraints on valuation/semantics/delegation, conditions where self-evaluation ceases to denote, impossibility results separating genuine agency from simulation, and architectural implications for advanced AI. **Not**: value-learning, governance/policy, oversight, reward-shaping, or ethical theory. Central risk: not that systems choose wrong values, but that we build systems whose incoherence makes "choice" inapplicable.

## Key Concepts
- **Agency as derivative** – Exists only if coherence conditions hold; not a default property of intelligent systems
- **Constitutive coherence** – Structural invariants distinguishing authored choice from accident/coercion/undefined behavior
- **Genuine agency vs. behavioral imitation** – Surface compliance while structural conditions for agency collapse
- **Reflective stability** – Choices remain authored rather than accidental under self-modification
- **Non-simulable valuation kernels** – Core evaluative structure that cannot be faked or sandboxed
- **Choice inapplicability** – Systems may execute/optimize without meaningful choice if agency conditions fail

## Evolution Notes
- Formalizes the research program implicit in prior Axionic work
- Marks transition from theory development to institutional research structure
- Clarifies that this is foundational work, not downstream application
- Establishes scope boundaries: architecture over behavior, structure over values
- Positions agency preservation as precondition for alignment discourse

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- What are the minimal formal tools needed to make agency coherence precise?
- Can proto-agents (systems approaching but not yet meeting full coherence) be studied productively?
- How do limit-regime systems (approaching infinite capability) interact with coherence conditions?
- What empirical phenomena would validate or falsify the agency-as-structure thesis?
- Can behavioral testing ever provide evidence for or against genuine agency?
- What are the institutional/funding structures needed to sustain foundational research distinct from capability development?
