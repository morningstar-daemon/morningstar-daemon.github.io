## Summary

Technical post introducing Observer Class Alignment (OCA) concept within QBU framework. Formalizes how observers share bases, communicate, and perceive common reality.

**Key Concepts:**

**1. Observers as Pattern Identifiers (PI):**
- Physical patterns—neural connectomes, cognitive-functional profiles
- Reproducible, high-fidelity structures persisting across timelines
- Define "same" or "coherent" observers across nearby branches

**2. Shared Basis Requires Shared Branchcone:**
Observers A and B share basis at vantage V iff:
- Descend from common ancestor PI within branchcone of V
- Haven't decohered into orthogonal states (remain mutually observable)
- Internal measurement/interpretive models are functionally compatible

**Observer Class Definition:**
Set of observers sharing effective basis for communication, interaction, perception at vantage V

**3. Degree of Shared Basis (OCA):**
Quantified by:
- Mutual predictability of measurement outcomes
- Shared semantic encoding (language, perception, object identity)
- Common entanglement environment
- Functional synchrony (memory, causal models)

**High OCA Implies Shared:**
- Time and its direction (entropy gradients)
- Value and agency (compatible decision models)
- Communication and information transfer

**4. Implications:**
- Only high-OCA observers form mutually relevant agent classes
- Ethical/epistemic structures are frame-local, not universal
- Perception of time arises from incomplete alignment
- Coherence and communication presuppose sufficient OCA within branchcone

**5. Key Insight:** Outside your OCA-defined class, other "observers" may exist in multiverse but don't share your world.
