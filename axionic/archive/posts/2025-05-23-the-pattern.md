# [The Pattern](https://axionic.org/posts/164271340.the-pattern.html)

**Date:** 2025-05-23  

## Summary

Analyzes David Deutsch's "Pattern" (persistent cross-cultural antisemitism) via **Schelling point** theory. Schelling point = focal coordination solution (salient, historically reinforced). **Argument:** Antisemitism functions as perverse social Schelling point—once established (arbitrary/random initially), becomes self-reinforcing focal target for scapegoating. Contradictory rationalizations (too powerful/weak, wealthy/poor) reveal logic isn't primary; coordination is. Each instance reinforces focal point, making future occurrences more likely. **Implication:** Logical debunking insufficient; must disrupt *coordination mechanism* itself by creating alternative Schelling points (universal rights, anti-corruption focus). Applies coordination theory to explain irrational but persistent social phenomena. References Schelling's *Strategy of Conflict*.
