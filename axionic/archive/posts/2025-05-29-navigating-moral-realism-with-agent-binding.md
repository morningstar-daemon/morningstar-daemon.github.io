## Summary

**Agent-binding resolves Humean skepticism** about moral realism. **Hume's is/ought problem**: Moral claims ("lying is wrong") cannot logically follow from descriptive facts. **Agent-binding solution**: Transform vague moral claims into empirically verifiable statements ("Agent X believes lying is wrong"). **Positioning**: Navigates between J.L. Mackie's Error Theory (moral claims systematically false due to presupposing "queer" motivating properties) and Richard Joyce's Moral Fictionalism (morality = useful fiction). **Agent-binding compromise**: Acknowledges no universal moral truths (agrees with Mackie) but maintains empirical validity within agent-bound contexts (avoids pure fictionalism). Provides conditional objectivity—moral statements can be true or false relative to specific agents. **Key insight**: Context-dependent truth evaluation offers coherent philosophical resolution without assuming universal moral realism or collapsing into pure skepticism.
