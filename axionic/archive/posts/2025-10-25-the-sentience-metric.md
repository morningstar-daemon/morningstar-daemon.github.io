Distinguishes intelligence from sentience/experience. Intelligence: information processing capability. Sentience: subjective experience (qualia). Core insight: High intelligence doesn't imply conscious experience; system can be arbitrarily smart without phenomenal consciousness. Sentience remains philosophically/empirically elusive.
