## Summary
AI systems infer patterns but lack interpretive framework for meaning. Pattern recognition ≠ understanding. Missing: context, intentionality, semantic grounding. Core insight: Current AI doesn't "know what it doesn't know"—no epistemic humility or awareness of knowledge boundaries. Inference without interpretation produces confident nonsense.
