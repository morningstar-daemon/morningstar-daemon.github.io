## Summary

**Refinement of "sacrifice as signal"**: Sacrifice must be both willed and within one's power. **Problem**: Desire without capacity = cheap talk. Hypothetical sacrifice tells us nothing. **Key insight**: Value is not in dreams/fantasies/intentions. Value = what you're willing and able to give up in practice, under constraint, when other options available. **Sentimental error**: Confusing intense yearning with actual value ("I value education above all" but choose luxuries > tuition → revealed preference says otherwise). **Counterfactual value isn't value**: "I'd pay a million if I had it" = noise, not signal. **Opportunity cost matters**: What you actually sacrifice relative to agent's situation (abilities, resources, trade-offs). **Two people equally passionate, but one donates → that one values it more in practice**. Emotion without action = undifferentiated heat. Only constrained sacrifice generates signal. **Conclusion**: Value = what you were willing and able to give up when choice was real. Anything else = moral theater.
