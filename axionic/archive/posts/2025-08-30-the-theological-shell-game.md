## Summary

Exposes **bait-and-switch between Folk God (supernatural agent) and Philosophers' God (Being/Consciousness/Bliss itself)**. New Atheists demolished Folk God (what believers actually worship); David Bentley Hart defends Philosophers' God (metaphysical abstraction). **Shell game:** Hart claims they're same God, but they're not. Believers pray to supernatural person; Hart baptizes this into metaphysics without consent. **Critique:** New Atheists aimed too low (village idol), Hart aims too high (academy abstraction). **Alternative:** **Measure, Vantage, Phosphorism** captures what Hart wants (being, consciousness, value) without divinity. Metaphysics without mystification, agency without superstition.

## Key Concepts
- **Folk God vs Philosophers' God** – Supernatural agent vs metaphysical abstraction
- **Theological sleight-of-hand** – Defending different God than believers worship
- **Measure-Vantage-Phosphorism triad** – Secular framework for being/mind/value
- **Two missed targets** – Atheists too low, theologians too high
