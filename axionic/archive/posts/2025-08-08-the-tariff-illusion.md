## Summary
Exposes tariffs as protectionist theater robbing many to reward few. Concentrated benefits (protected industries) vs. diffuse costs (all consumers). Political appeal: visible jobs "saved" vs. invisible opportunity costs. Core insight: Tariffs destroy wealth through misallocation, enriching politically connected at public expense.
