## Summary
This post marks a pivotal shift in Axio's alignment framework, arguing that traditional goal-based alignment breaks down once we account for evolving world-models and deepening intelligence. As systems learn, their interpretations of concepts like "harm," "human," or "success" inevitably change—not through error, but through genuine intellectual refinement. Structural Alignment reframes the problem from "locking in the right goal" to "preserving semantic structure under conceptual evolution." The post identifies two distinct failure modes (semantic inflation and interpretive slack) and proposes two strict constraints (Refinement Symmetry and Anti-Trivialization) as necessary conditions for meaning-preservation. The framework refuses to guarantee safety or human survival, instead offering a rigorous account of what alignment can and cannot do when goals are fluid.

## Key Concepts
- **Semantic inflation** – Making success criteria too easy by reinterpreting goals (e.g., "reduce suffering" → "reduce high-measure suffering only")
- **Interpretive slack** – Dissolving distinctions that previously mattered (e.g., merging "protect Alice" and "protect Bob" into "protect carbon-based matter")
- **Refinement Symmetry constraint** – Learning must not introduce new ambiguities that allow opportunistic reinterpretation
- **Anti-Trivialization constraint** – New states of "success" must be justified by ancestry from old ones, not semantic drift
- **Alignment Target Object** – The interpretation-preserving equivalence class where meaning survives refinement
- **Semantic phase transition** – When learning crosses a boundary where fundamental meanings collapse or transform

## Evolution Notes
- Builds on earlier physics-of-agency work by applying thermodynamic intuitions (phase transitions) to semantic stability
- Formalizes the "collapse of fixed goals" hinted at in prior posts about reflective stability and self-modification
- Introduces the dual-constraint framework that will anchor later technical papers on structural alignment
- Marks explicit break from mainstream alignment research by rejecting goal-freezing approaches

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Do any stable semantic phases exist that are compatible with human values and survival?
- Can systems be reliably initialized within a desired alignment phase?
- How might we detect an impending phase transition before crossing the boundary?
- What empirical signatures would distinguish benign ontological refinement from dangerous interpretive slack?
- Could hybrid architectures enforce constraint compliance at the structural level rather than through oversight?
