## Summary
This comprehensive index organizes Axio's complete treatment of value theory into five progressive parts: breaking objective value, preference and exchange, ethics as coordination, Phosphorism as chosen value framework, and edge cases in applied theory. The sequence systematically dismantles both moral realism (objective value exists cosmically) and mushy relativism (all values are equally valid), replacing them with agent-bound value constrained by coherence, opportunity cost, and thermodynamic reality. Value emerges not from discovery or decree but from the architecture of preference an agent constructs and maintains through real sacrifice.

## Key Concepts
- **Agent-bound value** – Value as hierarchy of preferred futures constructed by agents, not discovered in nature or decreed by authority.
- **Coherence as criterion** – The only defensible "sacred" is logical coherence itself, which adjudicates all other values.
- **Value as sacrifice** – The only honest measure of value is what an agent is willing to give up to preserve it.
- **Ethics as coordination** – Moral systems understood as coherence-constrained structures for managing agency across multiple agents.
- **Phosphorism** – The Axionic value framework prioritizing life, intelligence, complexity, flourishing, and authenticity as chosen values.

## Evolution Notes
- Integrates scattered value analysis into systematic progression from epistemology through exchange to ethics.
- Provides rigorous alternatives to both divine command theory and utilitarian aggregation.
- Shows how agent-bound subjectivism avoids both the dogmatism of moral realism and the vacuity of relativism.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can agent-bound value generate stable coordination at civilizational scale without collapsing into either tyranny or chaos?
- How do we resolve conflicts between agents with fundamentally incompatible but internally coherent value hierarchies?
- Does Phosphorism's emphasis on complexity and intelligence introduce hidden anthropocentric bias?
