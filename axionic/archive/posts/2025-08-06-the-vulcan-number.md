# The Vulcan Number

**Date:** August 6, 2025  
**Batch:** Batch 24 (Posts 1–25)

## Summary

Introduces A308705 (OEIS), the "Vulcan Number"—a computable, explicitly constructed normal number in base 2. Created by concatenating every finite binary string in shortlex order (0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, ...). Unlike π or e (conjectured normal but unproven), this construction guarantees every bit pattern appears exactly once, strongly suggesting normality. Demonstrates how theoretical concepts can be given explicit form through creative construction rather than empirical discovery.

**Key Points:**
- Most real numbers are normal (Borel, 1909), but proving specific constants normal remains unsolved
- Vulcan Number: 0.0100011011000001... (concatenating all binary strings)
- Computable and simple (intro CS-level algorithm)
- Decimal approximation: 0.276387117279...
- Explicit example for educational purposes

**Significance:** Shows normality through construction, not proof. Illustrates how creativity fills gaps when natural examples lack proofs.
