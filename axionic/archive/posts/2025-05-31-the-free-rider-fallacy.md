## Summary

**Free rider problem ≠ proof of objective value.** Often cited to justify coercive taxation (roads, defense, clean air = "public goods" benefiting non-payers). **Core fallacy**: Confusing coordination failures with value itself. **Analysis**: (1) Non-excludable goods create incentive misalignment (real), but (2) Benefiting ≠ valuing (crucial distinction). **Value = revealed through sacrifice** (willingness to pay). If people won't pay voluntarily, they don't value it enough—benefit is parasitic on coercion. (3) Free rider rhetoric = circular: assumes objective value → punishes non-payers → calls this "fair." **Key insight**: Benefit ≠ sacrifice. Usage ≠ willingness to pay. Aggregating preferences doesn't erase subjective nature—it obscures it. **Alternative solutions**: Coordination mechanisms without coercion exist (assurance contracts, crowdfunding, DAOs, open-source software). **Conclusion**: Free rider fallacy smuggles coercion as "technical fix." Stop mistaking collective convenience for moral necessity.
