# The Pragmatic Self

**Batch:** Batch 16 (New remaining list, posts 2-26)

## Summary
This post develops concept of **pragmatic self** - identity as constructed through choices and actions rather than discovered essence. **Rejects essentialist view**: no pre-existing "true self" waiting to be discovered. **Instead, self emerges from pattern of decisions, commitments, behaviors over time**. You are what you do, not what you claim to be or wish you were. **Key insight: identity is performative, not essential** - we create ourselves through iterative action, not unveil hidden nature. **Sartrean influence**: echoes existentialist theme of existence preceding essence. **We are condemned to be free** - no predetermined nature constrains choices, but this freedom is burden requiring continuous self-creation. **Pragmatic self-construction**: Rather than agonizing over "who I really am," focus on **"who am I becoming through my choices?"** Identity emerges from accumulated pattern of actions. **Implications for authenticity**: **Authenticity isn't alignment with pre-existing essence but consistency between stated values and actual behavior**. Authentic person is one whose actions reliably reflect articulated commitments. **Bad faith**: Sartre's concept - pretending choices are constrained by fixed nature ("I'm just not that kind of person"). **Bad faith is denial of radical freedom to self-construct**. **Pragmatic approach rejects both essentialism and nihilistic "anything goes"** - while no fixed essence constrains, commitments made through actions create real constraints. Past choices shape present self, limiting future possibilities. **Self as recursive process**: Each choice influences who you are, which influences future choices. **Identity emerges from this recursive loop of action-reflection-action**. **Practical applications**: (1) Want to be courageous? Perform courageous acts repeatedly until courage becomes habitual. (2) Want to be honest? Practice honesty in small things until it becomes automatic. (3) Want to be kind? Enact kindness systematically until it becomes character trait. **Conclusion**: **Self is not found but forged through decisions and actions**. Pragmatic self-construction offers liberation from essentialist anxiety ("am I being my true self?") while avoiding nihilistic drift ("I can be anything"). **You become who you choose to be, one decision at a time**.

## Key Concepts
- **Pragmatic self** - Identity constructed through choices/actions, not discovered essence.
- **Performative identity** - Self created through iterative action, not unveiling hidden nature.
- **Existence precedes essence** - Sartrean existentialism: no predetermined nature constrains choices.
- **Self-construction** - Creating identity through accumulated pattern of decisions.
- **Authenticity redefined** - Consistency between values and behavior, not essence-alignment.
- **Bad faith** - Pretending choices constrained by fixed nature, denying radical freedom.
- **Recursive self-process** - Each choice influences identity, which influences future choices.
- **Habitual character** - Repeated actions become automatic traits.
- **Commitment constraints** - Past choices create real limitations on future possibilities.
- **Anti-essentialism** - No pre-existing "true self" to discover.

## Evolution Notes
- **Bridges existentialism (Sartre) with pragmatism and agency framework**.
- Self-as-recursive-process connects to Minds as Recursive Simulations.
- Performative identity anticipates You Are Your Choices, Identity Engineering.
- Bad faith concept recurs in discussions of authenticity, self-deception.
- Rejects essentialist identity (no soul, no fixed nature) - consistent materialist stance.
- Practical self-construction (courage through courageous acts) exemplifies embodied virtue.
- Sets up later discussions: identity horizon, reflexive coherence, sovereign self.
- Demonstrates pattern: ground abstract concepts (self, identity) in concrete processes (choices, actions).
- Connects to agency protection principle: agency includes self-modification capacity.
- Anticipates discussions of reflective stability, kernel boundaries, self-modification constraints.

## Open Questions
- Does pragmatic self allow for genuine change or only reinforce existing patterns?
- Can self-construction be too deliberate, becoming inauthentic performance?
- How do we distinguish between self-creation and self-deception?
- Does recursive self-process have stable attractors or is drift inevitable?
- Can traumatic past constrain self-construction despite nominal freedom?
- Is there minimal continuity required for identity or can self radically transform?
- How do we handle conflict between desired self and habitual self?
- Does pragmatic self require conscious deliberation or can it be unconscious?
- Can collective identity (cultural, national) be pragmatically constructed?
- Is there tension between pragmatic self and psychological research on personality stability?
- How does pragmatic self relate to neurodiversity (autism, ADHD) where traits seem fixed?
- Can self-construction overcome biological/genetic predispositions?
