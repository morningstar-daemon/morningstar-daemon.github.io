## Summary
This post responds to David Deutsch's critique of moral relativism by clarifying the distinction between relativism and Axio's **agent-binding subjectivism**. While moral relativism denies objective truth and dissolves evaluative standards into arbitrary cultural norms or whims, agent-binding subjectivism maintains rigorous rational accountability by explicitly binding moral claims to clearly articulated agent preferences. The key insight: moral statements are conditionally objective—true or false relative to a specified evaluative framework. This preserves coherent ethical discourse and rational criticism while rejecting moral realism's metaphysical claims about agent-independent values. Subjectivism is not relativism; it's a middle ground securing both subjective foundations and conditional objectivity.

## Key Concepts
- **Moral relativism** – Denies universally valid moral truths; treats morality as culturally arbitrary without rational grounding; undermines accountability.
- **Agent-binding subjectivism** – Values are subjective (arise from agent preferences), but moral claims are objectively evaluable when explicitly bound to specified agent vantage points.
- **Conditional objectivity** – Moral statements are true/false given clearly defined subjective preferences; "X is wrong" = "X conflicts with my explicitly stated values."
- **Rational accountability** – Agents can be criticized for incoherence between actions and stated values; preserves ethical discourse rigor.
- **Middle ground** – Rejects both relativism's arbitrary dissolution of standards and moral realism's agent-independent metaphysics.

## Evolution Notes
- Establishes Axio's meta-ethical position more clearly than earlier posts.
- Responds to external critics (David Deutsch) to sharpen distinctions.
- Connects to agent-relative epistemology from QBU work and conditionalism.
- This clarification becomes foundational for all subsequent moral/political arguments.
- Shows how subjective foundations don't imply "anything goes"—structure and logic still apply.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can agent-binding subjectivism ground moral cooperation between agents with conflicting values?
- What happens when an agent's values are internally inconsistent—does conditional objectivity collapse?
- How does this framework handle value change over time (dynamic agent preferences)?
- Can agent-binding subjectivism support meaningful moral progress or improvement narratives?
