## Summary
This post preemptively addresses four major critiques of Axio's agency-based political framework (introduced in "Upgrading Liberty"), demonstrating philosophical rigor and practical resilience. **Critique 1: Agency maximization is utilitarianism in disguise**—Reply: Agency differs from utility by focusing on measurable capabilities/opportunities rather than subjective preference satisfaction, explicitly accounting for coercion as harm, thus limiting scenarios where individual autonomy is overridden. Prioritizes preserving individual choice capacities against coercion. **Critique 2: Framework ignores moral rights**—Reply: Rights understood as preferences society enforces against coercion; while no right is absolute, agency model places exceptionally high burden of proof on coercive intervention, making overriding rights exceedingly rare, justified only where overall agency significantly improves. **Critique 3: Quantifying agency is impossible or arbitrary**—Reply: Agency defined objectively through capacities (physical, cognitive, financial resources) and available meaningful choices (absence of coercion, opportunity availability). While precise numerical quantification challenging, relative comparisons of agency gains/losses remain practical and robust. Framework acknowledges epistemic uncertainty, requiring only clarity in directional effects, not precise numerical values. **Critique 4: Agency-maximization enables authoritarian overreach**—Reply: Coercion inherently reduces agency by definition, so framework inherently opposes authoritarianism. Built-in bias favors voluntary, minimally coercive interventions, requiring clear concrete evidence of significant agency gains strongly outweighing immediate coercive losses. Guards against authoritarian misuse through stringent standards and transparent evaluations. The framework integrates coercion's ethical cost and objective empirical measures, robustly safeguarding individual autonomy while clearly distinguishing justified from unjustified interventions.

## Key Concepts
- **Δ Net Agency rule** – Political interventions justified by measurable increase in aggregate agency.
- **Agency vs. utility** – Capabilities/opportunities (objective) vs. preference satisfaction (subjective).
- **Coercion as harm** – Explicit accounting for coercion as agency reduction, limiting acceptable overrides.
- **Rights as enforced preferences** – Rights not absolute but require high burden of proof to override.
- **Objective quantification** – Agency measured through capacities, resources, available choices, absence of coercion.
- **Relative comparisons** – Framework requires directional clarity, not precise numerical values.
- **Anti-authoritarian bias** – Coercion inherently reduces agency, favoring voluntary interventions.
- **Epistemic humility** – Acknowledging measurement uncertainty while maintaining practical utility.

## Evolution Notes
- Direct response to anticipated objections to "Upgrading Liberty" framework.
- Demonstrates Axio's philosophical rigor—preemptively addressing critiques before they arise.
- Positions agency framework as distinct from utilitarianism (common philosophical conflation).
- Shows concern with preventing misuse by authoritarian actors (pragmatic political realism).
- Reflects commitment to objectivity in ethics—measurable capacities vs. subjective states.
- Connects to later work on Physics of Agency—grounding political philosophy in physical/causal reality.
- Part of broader pattern: libertarian-adjacent politics with rigorous philosophical foundations.
- May indicate Axio's awareness of philosophical community's likely objections.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can agency framework truly avoid utilitarian failure modes, or is the distinction semantic?
- What constitutes "significant" agency gain—who decides the threshold for justified coercion?
- How measure cognitive/psychological capacities objectively without invasive assessment?
- Does prioritizing agency inherently favor the capable/privileged over the disadvantaged?
- Can "absence of coercion" be measured objectively, or does it involve subjective perception?
- How handle cases where expanding agency for some necessarily constrains agency for others?
- Does framework account for non-human agency (animals, AI, ecosystems)?
- What prevents "agency washing"—justifying existing power structures as agency-maximizing?
- How reconcile agency framework with democratic legitimacy—can majority will override agency calculations?
