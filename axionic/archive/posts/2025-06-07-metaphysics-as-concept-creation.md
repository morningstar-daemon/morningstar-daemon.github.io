**Date:** 2025-06-07  

## Summary

Reframes metaphysics as creative concept-building rather than discovery of hidden truths. Pragmatic, anti-realist view of metaphysical inquiry.

**Key Concepts:**

**Traditional View vs New Framing:**
- **Traditional:** Metaphysics discovers hidden truths about independent reality
- **New:** Metaphysics actively generates conceptual frameworks for structuring experience

**Metaphysics as Invention:**
- Concepts like causality, substance, identity, modality, time are constructed, not discovered
- Provide coherence to understanding, serve as foundational scaffolds
- Don't emerge from empirical observation alone

**Evaluative Criteria:**
Rather than chasing metaphysical "truths," assess systems by:
- Utility
- Clarity
- Coherence
- Explanatory power

**Implications:**
- Metaphysical disputes = discussions about which concepts serve epistemic goals most effectively
- Aligns metaphysics with creativity (like art or mathematical invention)
- Liberates from dogmatic realism and nihilistic skepticism
- Encourages deliberate, purposeful concept formation

**Central Insight:** Metaphysics is the creative act of crafting new ways to see, understand, and engage with the world.
