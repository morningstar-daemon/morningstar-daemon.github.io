**Date:** November 09, 2025  
**Type:** Sequence Navigation  
**Series:** Physics of Agency

## Overview

A 10-part formal sequence developing agency as a physical process. Builds from energy, entropy, and information primitives to show how intention, autonomy, and meaning emerge from their interaction. Provides thermodynamic and informational foundations for genuine agency through coherence, feedback, and branching dynamics.

## Core Concepts

### Three Laws of Agency
1. **Control Work:** Control requires energy expenditure against entropy
2. **Agency Decay:** Control capacity degrades without replenishment
3. **Agency Limits:** Control bounded by information/energy constraints

### Key Theoretical Constructs
- **Kybit:** Unit of control (from KL divergence)
- **Agency as physical quantity:** Alongside energy and entropy
- **Thermodynamic opposition to drift:** Active maintenance of order
- **Coherence filters:** Agents selecting across branching timelines
- **QBU framework:** Quantum Branching Universe model

### Emergence Architecture
```
Primitives: Energy + Entropy + Information
    ↓
Thermodynamic Process: Free energy → Directed work
    ↓
Agency Properties: Intention, autonomy, control
    ↓
Higher-Order: Meaning, ethics, value
```

## Philosophical Position

- **Physicalist intentionality:** Intention grounded in measurable physical processes
- **Formal agency theory:** Mathematical foundations for autonomous systems
- **Emergence without dualism:** Higher-order properties from physical constraints
- **Quantifiable control:** Agency as measurable KL divergence from drift

## Related Frameworks
- Thermodynamics (2nd law, free energy)
- Information theory (KL divergence, Shannon entropy)
- Quantum mechanics (branching, multiverse)
- Control theory (feedback, optimization)
- Evolution (selection, adaptation)

## Implications

### For AI/AGI
- Agency can be formally measured and engineered
- Control capacity has physical limits
- Sustainable agency requires energy/information replenishment
- Alignment = coherence optimization under constraints

### For Philosophy of Mind
- Intention as physical process, not epiphenomenon
- Consciousness may correlate with control capacity
- Meaning emerges from thermodynamic coherence
- Ethics grounded in agency physics
