# [The Quantum Branching Universe (QBU)](https://axionic.org/posts/162844036.the-quantum-branching-universe-qbu.html)

**Date:** 2025-05-04  

## Summary

Formal framework for representing all physically possible quantum timelines as directed acyclic graph (DAG).

**Structure:** QBU = (V, E) where:
- V = set of all quantum events
- E = directed edges indicating temporal/causal ordering
- Paths through DAG = distinct timelines

**Ancestor Event:** Ea precedes Eb if all timelines through Eb necessarily pass through Ea.

**Pattern Identifiers (PIs):** Precise, reproducible patterns selecting timeline subsets:
- **Strong PIs:** All matching timelines share common ancestor (strict causal clarity). Examples: genotypes, neural connectomes, specific quantum states.
- **Weak PIs:** No common ancestor required (cultural/historical identification). Examples: names, cultural labels, general events.

**Operations:**
- Match: Select timelines containing pattern
- Select: Identify subset matching PI
- Ancestor/Descendant: Trace causal relationships

**Block Universe Relationship:** QBU extends classical Block Universe (static 4D spacetime). QBU = vast structure of potentially infinite distinct block universes, each representing unique deterministic timeline. Branching characterizes structural relationships at quantum divergence points, not dynamic progression.

**Key Insight:** Enables rigorous exploration of causality, counterfactual reasoning, choice by modeling alternative outcomes as equally real, coexisting timelines.
