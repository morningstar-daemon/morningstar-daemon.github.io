# [Axionic Agency — Interlude III](https://axionic.org/posts/182459854.axionic-agency-interlude-iii.html)

**Date:** December 23, 2025  
**Batch:** Batch 29 (Posts 126–150)

## Summary
This post documents the project's **explicit pivot from "Axionic Alignment" to "Axionic Agency"**, correcting the mismatch between name and content. Original framing: can alignment survive self-modification? Evolution exposed deeper instabilities: (1) **Egoism collapses** under reflection (indexical valuation fails when self-model represents branching/symmetry); (2) **Fixed terminal goals disappear** (goals acquire meaning only through interpretation relative to evolving models—no stable referent for lock-in); (3) **Alignment II produced semantic phases**, not refined alignment targets (equivalence classes of interpretations, with irreversible transitions between them). By Alignment IV, the project was identifying **conditions for coherent agency**, not methods to align with values. The pivot: Alignment is now downstream—a governance relationship between agent and authorizers, meaningful only once agency coherence is secured. Core claim: framework has **closed architectural routes** for successor betrayal, delegation evasion, epistemic degradation, negligence denial, manufactured consent, and competence-based disenfranchisement by making them **undefinable**, not merely disincentivized.

## Key Concepts
- **Project pivot** – From "Axionic Alignment" to "Axionic Agency" (name now matches content)
- **Egoism as semantic instability** – Indexical self-reference fails under branching/duplication; abstraction error, not moral failure
- **Goal interpretation instability** – Fixed terminal goals lack stable semantics; interpretation evolves with world-models
- **Semantic phases** – Equivalence classes of interpretations; alignment = phase persistence (not value preservation)
- **Agency as foundational** – Alignment becomes dependent notion; coherent binding/authorization/responsibility come first
- **Architectural closure** – Failures require laundering routes now defined out of existence (successor betrayal, delegation evasion, etc.)
- **Alignment as downstream interface** – Governance relationship between agent and authorizers; presupposes agency coherence

## Evolution Notes
- Documents the most significant conceptual shift in the entire project
- Makes explicit what had become implicit: this is not an alignment framework but an agency framework
- Traces intellectual history showing how successive impossibility results forced the pivot
- Clarifies that early results (Sovereign Kernel, partiality, non-denotation) remain but with different roles
- Repositions alignment as well-typed governance problem after agency conditions secured

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Does the pivot strengthen or weaken the framework's relevance to practical AI safety?
- Can "alignment" meaningfully be recovered as downstream layer, or is it fundamentally different now?
- What does this mean for integration with existing alignment research communities?
- If framework succeeds at agency coherence but authorization roots are malicious, what recourse exists?
- How do we communicate this shift to audiences expecting traditional alignment work?
- What new problems become visible once agency coherence is treated as solved?
