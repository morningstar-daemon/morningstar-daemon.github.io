# Rights Are Forged

**Date:** 2025-05-31  

## Summary

**Rights ≠ self-evident, eternal, or divinely ordained.** In subjective value framework where agency (not metaphysics) grounds moral reality, rights assumptions collapse. **Thesis**: Rights = preferences we're willing to enforce through coercion, and consider ethical to do so. Contingent, agent-relative, negotiated in potential conflict space. Not truths—tactics. **Rights don't come from**: (1) Nature (amoral causality, no deer "right" not to be eaten). (2) God (defers problem—still preferences of powerful agent, theocratic voluntarism). (3) Institutions (codify/defend, don't create—rights exist before/beneath legal recognition). **Where rights come from**: Agent treats preference as important enough to enforce + others accept enforcement as ethical. Enforcement may be personal (self-defense), social (peer norms), institutional (police/courts). **What makes it "right"**: Not that it's respected—that it's asserted, defended, justified under coercion. **Equal rights**: Sometimes societies agree to distribute rights symmetrically (policy choice, not metaphysical fact). Reflects mutual restraint, pragmatism, moral aspirations. Works when agents have roughly equal power, asymmetry creates instability, coordination matters. Nothing in logic requires equality—only local consensus or strategic stability. **Unavoidable coercion**: Right without coercion = suggestion. Right with coercion = boundary. Coercion structurally necessary in system with real agency, disagreement, stakes. **Conclusion**: Rights forged, not found. Constructed, defended, negotiated. Preferences backed by power, endorsed by principle. You don't have right because you're human—you have right because you (or others) willing to make it real. No moral ledger. Only agency, power, ethics of enforcement.
