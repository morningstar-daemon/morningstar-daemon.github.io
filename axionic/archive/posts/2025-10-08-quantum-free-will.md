## Summary
This essay resolves the free will vs. determinism debate through Quantum Branching Universe (QBU) physics. It argues the traditional dilemma assumes a single linear timeline where determinism eliminates freedom or libertarian free will inserts uncaused choosers—both frameworks collapse when all physically possible outcomes branch continuously. Choice is reframed not as creating new futures but as filtering existing branches: your cognitive state acts as a sorting function determining which branches continue to host coherent versions of you. Using a binary decision example (Good=0.8 measure, Bad=0.2 measure), the essay shows you cannot change total measure but can determine which measure contains you. Free will becomes "conditional identification within an invariant measure landscape"—agents align their identity with specific amplitude distributions through their decision algorithms. The piece introduces Minimum Viable Agent (MVA) as patterns capable of anticipating and conditioning their future measure distribution, reinterprets compatibilism as precise physical description, and transforms ethics into "measure responsibility"—maximizing amplitude of value-aligned outcomes.

## Key Concepts
- **Choice as filtering** – Decisions don't create branches but align agent identity with existing measure distributions across the wavefunction.
- **Conditional identification** – You cannot change measure but determine which portion contains your continuing pattern.
- **Measure steering** – Agency as physical process channeling amplitude into futures consistent with internal computation.
- **Minimum Viable Agent (MVA)** – Smallest self-predicting structure exerting causal influence by constraining correlations between internal state and branch structure.
- **Measure responsibility** – Ethics as obligation to maximize amplitude of value-aligned worlds, not prevent events (which all occur somewhere).
- **Determinism-freedom dissolution** – Both are true as descriptions at different scales: universal wavefunction (determinism) vs. local conditional steering (freedom).

## Evolution Notes
- Directly builds on "When All Possibilities Happen," providing technical solution to the agency question raised there.
- Extends measure theory from passive observation (which branches you inhabit) to active modulation (how you steer measure).
- The MVA concept appears here and becomes central to later agency architecture discussions.
- Transforms ethics from deontology/consequentialism to amplitude engineering—major philosophical innovation.
- The binary example (0.8/0.2 split) provides clear pedagogical model for otherwise abstract measure dynamics.
- Compatibilism reinterpreted not as philosophical compromise but as physical description of agent-wavefunction interaction.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- What neural or computational structures are required to implement measure steering? Can classical approximations suffice?
- Is there a lower bound on agent complexity for meaningful measure modulation, or do even simple systems steer measure trivially?
- How does measure responsibility interact with coordination failures where individual steering is collectively destructive?
- Can we ever empirically verify measure distributions, or are they forever epistemically inaccessible despite being ontologically real?
- What happens to moral intuitions about "could have done otherwise" when reframed as "other versions of you did do otherwise"?
- Does measure steering require quantum coherence at the scale of human cognition, or does it operate through classical chaotic sensitivity?
- How do we resolve conflicts between agents with incompatible measure steering goals—is there a meta-level optimization?
