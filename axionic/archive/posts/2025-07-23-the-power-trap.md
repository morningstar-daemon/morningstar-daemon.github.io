## Summary
This post examines research linking postmodern views with authoritarianism, engaging with Claire Lehmann's insight: "If you believe everything is about power, you're going to want power." Study by Deverson et al. (2025) demonstrates statistically significant correlation between postmodern beliefs (skepticism toward objective truth, reason, scientific inquiry) and higher scores on left-wing authoritarianism (LWA). Authors suggest postmodernism's emphasis on viewing reality as socially constructed and structured by power dynamics predisposes individuals to authoritarian methods as legitimate tools for social change. **However, correlation is not causation**—several alternative explanations: **(1) Shared psychological traits**—Individuals drawn to postmodern perspectives and authoritarianism might possess common personality features (high neuroticism, low openness to differing viewpoints); both ideologies could independently appeal to those seeking cognitive/emotional security. **(2) Social and academic environments**—Institutional cultures (especially universities) could simultaneously encourage conformity to both postmodern ideology and authoritarian social norms through peer pressure and social signaling. **(3) Epistemic vacuum and moral certainty**—Relativism inherent in postmodernism could leave individuals craving moral/epistemic certainty; authoritarian ideologies providing clear moral frameworks become attractive solutions to cognitive dissonance. **(4) Identity and group dynamics**—Postmodernism's focus on power dynamics and marginalized identities might lead to authoritarian approaches as protective strategies, appearing justified as necessary reactions to perceived threats/injustices. **(5) Methodological factors**—Correlation could be inflated by overlapping constructs in survey measurement or participants' desire for ideological consistency. **(6) Reverse causation**—Pre-existing authoritarian inclinations might drive selective adoption of postmodern beliefs to rationalize power-driven methodologies. Calls for future research through longitudinal studies, personality assessments, qualitative analyses. Emphasizes caution: correlation alone doesn't establish definitive causation.

## Key Concepts
- **Power-centric worldview** – Belief that everything is about power predisposes toward seeking power.
- **Postmodernism-authoritarianism correlation** – Statistical link between postmodern beliefs and left-wing authoritarianism.
- **Socially constructed reality** – Postmodern emphasis on power dynamics in knowledge construction.
- **Epistemic vacuum** – Relativism creating craving for moral/epistemic certainty.
- **Correlation vs. causation** – Statistical association doesn't prove causal mechanism.
- **Alternative explanations** – Shared traits, social environments, reverse causation, methodological artifacts.
- **Moral framework hunger** – Authoritarianism as solution to postmodern relativism's uncertainty.
- **Protective authoritarianism** – Coercive methods justified as defense against perceived injustice.

## Evolution Notes
- Critique of postmodernism as philosophically and politically problematic—consistent theme in Axio's work.
- Demonstrates epistemic humility—acknowledging correlation ≠ causation despite ideological alignment with critique.
- Part of broader anti-postmodern, anti-relativist pattern throughout corpus.
- Shows engagement with social psychology, empirical research on ideology.
- Connects to themes of objective truth, reason, scientific inquiry as foundational values.
- Positions postmodernism as epistemically dangerous—leading to authoritarianism through relativism.
- May be responding to rationalist/EA community discourse on academic political ideology.
- Reflects concern with institutional capture by postmodern/progressive ideology.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Does postmodernism inevitably lead to authoritarianism, or is correlation contingent on other factors?
- Can one embrace power-analysis without becoming power-seeking?
- What distinguishes healthy skepticism of authority from postmodern relativism?
- Is epistemic certainty always dangerous, or does it depend on content of certainties?
- How prevent critiques of postmodernism from becoming anti-intellectual reactionism?
- Can left-wing politics avoid authoritarianism without abandoning power-analysis?
- What role does academic environment play—is postmodernism cause or symptom of institutional capture?
- Does conditionalism avoid postmodern relativism's problems while maintaining anti-foundationalism?
- How measure authoritarianism fairly across political spectrum—is LWA scale valid?
