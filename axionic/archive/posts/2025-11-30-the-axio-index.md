## Summary
This master index maps the complete architecture of Axio across twelve major sequences, revealing how each layer solves tensions created by its predecessors. The progression moves from algorithmic chaos through quantum mechanics, agency physics, cybernetic control, epistemology, probability, hybrid cognition, strategic metagames, value theory, political philosophy, artificial intelligence, and finally alignment theory. The index demonstrates that Axio was not designed top-down but evolved organically as each sequence generated questions only the next could answer, creating a coherent multi-layered framework for understanding reality, agency, and coordination.

## Key Concepts
- **Layered architecture** – Axio as emergent system where each sequence builds on and constrains those beneath it.
- **Chaos to civilization** – The full trajectory from infinite randomness to coordinated agency-preserving governance.
- **Sequence interdependence** – Each sequence solves problems generated by earlier ones, creating natural progression.
- **Canonical map** – The authoritative guide to Axio's structure and recommended reading order for maximum coherence.
- **Self-referential system** – Axio studying its own construction tools through the Dialectic Catalyst Sequence.

## Evolution Notes
- Provides 10,000-foot view of entire Axio project as unified intellectual architecture.
- Reveals organic growth pattern: sequences weren't planned but emerged from necessity.
- Shows how technical foundations (chaos, quantum, thermodynamics) ground philosophical conclusions (value, politics, alignment).

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Will additional sequences continue emerging, or has Axio reached architectural completion?
- How would contradictions between sequences be resolved if discovered?
- Could this architecture be formalized mathematically as category theory or similar framework?
