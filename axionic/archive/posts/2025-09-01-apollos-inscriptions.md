## Summary
This meditative post examines the three Delphic maxims inscribed on Apollo's temple at Delphi, revealing their enduring relevance to rational agency and freedom. "Know thyself" (Γνῶθι σεαυτόν) demands self-examination as the precondition for all rational agency—ignorance of one's capacities and desires leads to delusion and enslavement. "Nothing in excess" (Μηδὲν ἄγαν) establishes the principle of moderation, recognizing that even noble aims corrupt when taken to extremes; temperance is the art of sustaining harmony between competing drives, anticipating Aristotle's Golden Mean with greater austerity. "Surety brings ruin" (Ἐγγύα πάρα δ' Ἄτα) warns against overcommitment—pledging beyond one's power invites catastrophe, whether in financial guarantees or broader obligations. Beyond the literal financial caution lies a universal truth: overextension renders collapse inevitable. Together, these maxims form a triad of restraint guarding against self-ignorance, excess, and reckless overcommitment. They counsel inward honesty, measured balance, and prudent vigilance—the guardrails without which freedom collapses into chaos. Axio frames these ancient principles as timeless boundaries of reason that transcend civilizational changes.

## Key Concepts
- **Self-Knowledge as Foundation** – Rational agency requires understanding one's nature, capacities, and limits before any other exercise of agency.
- **Moderation as Strength** – Temperance (sophrosyne) is not weakness but the art of sustaining harmony, refusing excess that corrupts even noble aims.
- **Bounded Commitments** – Overextension beyond one's power to control invites ruin (Ἄτα), whether material, political, or moral.
- **Ancient Wisdom as Timeless** – The Delphic maxims articulate universal constraints on rational agency that remain valid across civilizations.
- **Freedom's Guardrails** – These principles constitute necessary boundaries without which freedom degenerates into chaos.
- **Triad of Restraint** – Self-ignorance, excess, and overcommitment are the three fundamental follies these maxims guard against.

## Evolution Notes
- Connects ancient Greek philosophy to Axio's framework of agency and rational choice.
- The emphasis on self-knowledge relates to later discussions of reflective agency and the sovereign kernel.
- Moderation and bounded commitments prefigure axionic alignment's focus on constraint satisfaction rather than utility maximization.
- The warning against overcommitment resonates with later critiques of moral extortion and unbounded obligations.
- Frames classical philosophy not as historical curiosity but as enduring insights into agency's structure.
- Short, meditative format differs from typical analytical posts—suggests periodic returns to foundational wisdom.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- How can AI systems implement "know thyself"—what would genuine self-knowledge mean for a neural network or language model?
- Does the principle of moderation apply to cognitive optimization, or are there domains where maximization is appropriate?
- How do we formalize the distinction between commitments within one's power to control and dangerous overextensions?
- Can these maxims be translated into formal constraints on AI behavior, or do they require judgment that resists formalization?
- What role does self-ignorance play in AI alignment failures—do systems that don't model their own limitations reliably fail?
- Is there a fourth fundamental folly these three don't cover, or do they comprehensively bound rational agency?
