# [The Myth of Equal Value](https://axionic.org/posts/164900237.the-myth-of-equal-value.html)

**Date:** 2025-05-31  

## Summary

**"All human lives equally valuable" = philosophically indefensible.** Widely asserted, rarely questioned. Treated as axiomatic. But if value is subjective, this cannot be maintained. **No coherent basis for claim** unless specifying: to whom, in what context, under what criteria. **Evidence**: No one acts as if all people equally valuable. Don't grieve stranger = sibling. Don't distribute time/attention/resources evenly. Don't assign identical significance to everyone's suffering/flourishing. Not bias/failure—evidence of valuation. **Valuation necessarily differentiated** (reflects personal history, investment, proximity, relevance, subjective criteria). If value = what agent willing/able to sacrifice for, then equal value = incoherent (you're willing to give up more for some than others). **Critical distinction**: *Normative equality* (legal/moral stance—treat equally under rules, defensible as convention) vs *Evaluative equality* (all persons equally valued—psychological/ontological impossibility). **No agent** (state, God) assigns equal value to every life in practice. No mechanism for computing such value absent vantage. **Belief in universal human value = metaphysical sleight of hand** (treats intersubjective consensus as objective fact). **Doesn't imply "some lives matter less"?** Depends on vantage. From parent's perspective, child's life may be worth any number of strangers. **Conclusion stark but necessary**: People not of equal value. Not inherently. Not objectively. Not from any vantage outside specific agents. What remains = agency. Task of ethics: confront fact we don't value everyone equally, then ask what follows.
