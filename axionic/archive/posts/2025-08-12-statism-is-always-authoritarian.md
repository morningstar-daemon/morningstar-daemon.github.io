## Summary
This post argues **statism is structurally authoritarian by definition**, responding to Colin Wright's tweet: "It's not 'authoritarian' to enforce laws and arrest criminals." Problem: framing skips essential question—**Who defines the law, and by what right?** If law itself unjust, or enforcement rests on monopoly of coercion over peaceful individuals without consent, then it's authoritarian **by structure, not just by abuse**. **Core definitions:** (1) **Authoritarianism (structural)**—political system where central authority claims legitimate right to initiate coercion over peaceful individuals without their explicit, ongoing consent. (2) **Statism**—any system where state holds monopoly on law and force, with no competitive alternative individuals can freely choose/reject without forfeiting basic rights. **Key point: Statism is structural authoritarianism, varying only in degree.** **Why all statism is authoritarian:** (1) **Monopoly of force**—no peaceful opt-out; (2) **Presumed consent**—individuals treated as having agreed to system without explicit contract; (3) **Unilateral rule-making**—state decides what is "law" and can redefine crime at will; (4) **Coercive enforcement**—compliance backed by threat of force, even for victimless "offenses." Whether gentle authoritarianism (traffic laws enforced on non-consenting pacifists) or brutal authoritarianism (secret police breaking into homes), **mechanism is same**—state asserts right to coerce beyond voluntary agreement. **Continuum argument:** Difference between "friendly" democracies and brutal dictatorships not that one is authoritarian and other isn't—it's that **one uses authoritarian power sparingly and with social consent (for now)**. Underlying structural license to coerce identical. Once granted, can be expanded—and historically, often is. Post includes **spectrum of statism diagram** showing range from Nightwatchman State (minimal) → Constitutional Democracy (moderate) → Single-Party State (maximal), but argues all share core authoritarian structure. Concludes: **degree of authoritarianism varies, but structural authoritarianism inherent to all state systems**. Wright's tweet conflates law enforcement (mechanism) with law legitimacy (foundation)—assumes laws are just by definition, ignoring that unjust laws authoritarianly enforced are still authoritarian.

## Key Concepts
- **Structural authoritarianism** – System design granting authority right to coerce peaceful individuals without explicit consent.
- **Monopoly of force** – State's exclusive claim to legitimate violence/coercion within territory.
- **Presumed consent** – Treating individuals as having agreed to system without explicit, ongoing contractual agreement.
- **Unilateral rule-making** – State's power to define/redefine crime without individual veto rights.
- **Peaceful opt-out impossibility** – No way to reject state authority without emigrating or facing punishment.
- **Victimless offense enforcement** – Coercion applied even when no one harmed (drug use, sex work, consensual activities).
- **Continuum vs. binary** – Recognizing authoritarianism as spectrum, not categorical distinction between "free" and "tyrannical" states.
- **Law enforcement ≠ law legitimacy** – Mechanism of enforcement separate from question of whether law itself is just.

## Evolution Notes
- Core anarchist/libertarian thesis: all states inherently authoritarian by structural design.
- Builds on earlier liberty discussions: harm principle, individual sovereignty, non-coercion as default.
- Part of broader critique of political authority, state legitimacy, monopolies on force.
- Connects to later work on anarchy, governance without governments, voluntary association.
- Demonstrates principled consistency: rejects authoritarianism regardless of democratic legitimacy claims.
- Reflects commitment to individual agency as foundational—coercion requires explicit consent.
- Anticipates axiocracy discussions: governance systems not based on monopoly force.
- Shows willingness to challenge mainstream political assumptions (democracies as non-authoritarian).

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can any form of organized coercion (even defensive) avoid being "authoritarian" by this definition?
- Does unanimous explicit consent to a governance system make it non-authoritarian, or does monopoly force remain problematic?
- How do we handle collective action problems (tragedy of commons, free riders) without some coercive mechanism?
- Is there meaningful moral distinction between minimal state (nightwatchman) and anarcho-capitalism?
- Can individuals truly "opt out" of state systems in practice, or are exit costs so high it's coercion by another name?
- What about children born into states—when/how do they consent (or not)?
- Does democratic participation constitute ongoing consent, or is it still presumed/coerced?
- How should defensive force against aggression be organized without creating monopoly/state-like structure?
- Can polycentric legal systems avoid becoming de facto states through competitive consolidation?
- What happens when different voluntary governance systems have conflicting jurisdictional claims over same territory?
