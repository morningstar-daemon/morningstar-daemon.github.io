## Summary

Argues individualism is fundamentally more correct than collectivism across five criteria: (1) **Ontological clarity** — only individuals exist concretely as conscious agents; collectives are conceptual abstractions. (2) **Ethical justification** — ethics grounded in individual autonomy, dignity, and consent are more consistently defensible; collectivism often justifies problematic subordination of individual autonomy. (3) **Historical pragmatism** — liberal democracies (individualist) consistently outperform strongly collectivist societies in innovation, prosperity, and human rights. (4) **Psychological realism** — accommodates deep human drives for autonomy while allowing voluntary social integration. (5) **Logical soundness** — avoids attributing mental states or choices to abstract groups rather than actual decision-making agents. Key insight: collectivism-individualism is orthogonal to left-right political spectrum. Collective benefits (cooperation, mutual aid) can be fully realized within an individualist framework through voluntary association.
