## Summary

Argues individualism is fundamentally more correct than collectivism across five criteria: (1) Ontological clarity — only individuals exist concretely as conscious agents; collectives are abstractions. (2) Ethical justification — individual autonomy and consent are more consistently defensible. (3) Historical pragmatism — individualist societies outperform collectivist ones. (4) Psychological realism — accommodates drives for autonomy while allowing voluntary social integration. (5) Logical soundness — avoids attributing mental states to abstract groups. Collectivism's legitimate benefits (cooperation, mutual aid) can be realized through voluntary association within an individualist framework.

Personal philosophical statement on individualism. Likely argues from agency-preservation perspective: individuals as primary locus of agency, collective entities derivative. Connects to liberty, sovereignty, anti-collectivism themes. May critique utilitarian aggregation in favor of agent-relative value. Anticipates axiocracy, liberty, politics sequence. Positions Axio's political philosophy as libertarian/anarchist grounded in physics of agency rather than natural rights tradition.
