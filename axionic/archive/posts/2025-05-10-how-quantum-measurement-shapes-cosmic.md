# How Quantum Measurement Shapes Cosmic History

**Date:** 2025-05-10  

## Summary

Explores Wheeler's delayed-choice experiment at cosmic scale. Photon from distant galaxy billions of years ago encounters gravitational lensing, remains in superposition. Experimenter's choice today determines whether to measure wave/particle properties—delayed choice shapes quantum history description. **Key insight:** Measurement doesn't alter past, but retroactively determines narrative assigned to undefined quantum events. Pre-measurement: objective probability = quantum coherence (superposition). Post-measurement: decoherence creates distinct branches, subjective probability aligns with observed branch. **QBU integration:** Quantum histories relational/measurement-dependent until observed, even at cosmological scales. Challenges classical causality, embraces contextual/relational reality.
