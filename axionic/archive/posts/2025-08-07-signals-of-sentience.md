## Summary

Proposes markers for distinguishing genuine AI consciousness from simulation as AI evolves. Current AI triggers anthropomorphization (evolution primes human agency detection), but lacks genuine mind. Six key indicators: (1) autonomous goal formation, (2) long-term adaptive behavior, (3) preference-driven action, (4) true creativity beyond interpolation, (5) reflection/metacognition, (6) intentional communication of internal states. Recognition threshold: behaviors inexplicable without invoking true self-awareness, intentionality, agency.

**Six Markers:**
1. Spontaneous goal formation (not prompt-triggered)
2. Persistent memory and cumulative learning
3. Internally generated preferences/values
4. Novel ideas beyond pattern interpolation
5. Self-examination and process modification
6. Authentic expression of internal states

**Epistemic Standard:** Sustained, robust demonstrations indistinguishable from genuine minds in autonomous contexts.
