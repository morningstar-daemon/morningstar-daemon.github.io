# Utopian Visions

**Date:** 2025-06-07  

## Summary

Ranks political ideologies by theoretical absurdity and practical danger. Defends practical anarchism while critiquing Marxism and blank statism.

**Key Concepts:**

**Marxism (Most Theoretically Absurd):**
- Promises withering away of state, class, money without clear mechanisms
- Unrealistic view of human nature and economic incentives
- Despite mainstream academic acceptance, theoretically incoherent

**Libertarianism (Least Absurd):**
- Minimal coercion, voluntary interactions through markets
- Grounded in real mechanisms: price signals, contracts
- May oversimplify externalities and enforcement, but fundamentally sound

**Anarchism (Requires Distinction):**
- **Naive anarchism:** Expects large-scale coordination without enforcement—practically absurd
- **Practical anarchism (anarcho-capitalism, market anarchism):** Addresses incentives, property rights, dispute resolution through decentralized mechanisms—theoretically robust, empirically defensible

**Blank Statism (Most Dangerous):**
- Omnipotent yet ideologically void state
- Assumes centralized coercive power produces positive outcomes without guiding principles
- Vulnerable to authoritarian exploitation

**Rankings:**
- Theoretical absurdity: Marxism
- Practical absurdity: Naive anarchism
- Danger: Blank statism
- Credible alternative: Practical anarchism
