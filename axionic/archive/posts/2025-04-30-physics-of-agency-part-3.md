## Summary
Here the series defines the kybit as the quantitative measure of intentional control, instantiated as the KL divergence between the prior probability distribution over outcomes and the distribution realized through deliberate intervention. Examples using a forced coin flip and a biased die demonstrate how kybits accumulate when agents push uncertainty toward certainty. The post ties kybits directly to thermodynamic cost via Landauer-like considerations, implying that every bit of control has a minimum energetic price.

## Key Concepts
- **Kybit formalism** – Control is quantified via KL divergence, giving agency a rigorous numerical measure.
- **Worked examples** – Numerical demonstrations show how everyday interventions correspond to specific kybit counts.
- **Energy linkage** – Previews the forthcoming Law of Control Work by tying kybits to Boltzmann-limited energy expenditure.

## Evolution Notes
- Provides the mathematical backbone required for later laws; without a unit of control, cost and decay laws would remain qualitative.
- Moves the discourse from metaphorical “effort” to auditable metrics, paving the way for engineering applications.

## Open Questions
- How might real agents estimate KL divergence in high-dimensional or partially observed environments?
- Could kybit accounting become a governance requirement for powerful AI systems that manipulate large probability distributions?
