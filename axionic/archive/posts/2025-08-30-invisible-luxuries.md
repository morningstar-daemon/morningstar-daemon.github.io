## Summary

Meditation on **long, hot, private, cheap shower** as peak of invisible modern luxury—greater than skyscrapers/rockets. **Four dimensions:** Heat (tamed fire on demand), Privacy (solitude at will), Convenience (frictionless comfort), Cheapness (democratized indulgence). Kings never had it; you do daily. **Civilization's triumph:** Miles of infrastructure normalized into background. Greatest luxuries are unnoticed daily rituals. **Reminder:** Modernity's real miracles aren't iPhones but **invisible coordination/technology/abundance** giving private heaven every day. Lose it briefly (camping, broken heater) and you remember: it's sanctuary, not routine.

## Key Concepts
- **Invisible luxuries** – Greatest modern comforts go unnoticed
- **Civilization's triumph** – Infrastructure normalized into background
- **Democratized indulgence** – Luxuries kings never had, peasants take for granted
- **Invisible coordination** – Miracles of engineering made routine
