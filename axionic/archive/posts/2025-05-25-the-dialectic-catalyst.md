## Summary

Refines earlier "Dialectic Agent" term to **"Dialectic Catalyst"**—better captures current AI role. **Rationale:** "Agent" implies autonomy, intentionality, decision-making (premature for ChatGPT-like systems). **"Catalyst" correctly implies:** Facilitates/accelerates human intellectual development, stimulates clarity, challenges assumptions, identifies inconsistencies—but lacks independent goals/intentionality. AI as tool/accelerant, not autonomous participant. **Future note:** True "Dialectic Agents" (autonomous, intentional AI) may emerge later; distinction matters for setting expectations and responsible development. Short follow-up/clarification post; see original "Dialectic Agent" for context. Terminological precision reflecting philosophical rigor.
