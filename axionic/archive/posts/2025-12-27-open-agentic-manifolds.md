## Summary
This post introduces the **Sacrifice–Collapse Theorem**: any system whose performance reliably improves through non-consensual agency loss for a captive class will, under sustained optimization pressure, structurally collapse openness via exit suppression, conformity enforcement, or dependency erosion. The theorem formalizes how optimization converts agency-loss into control variable when standing asymmetry exists. "Open agentic manifolds" are regions of system-space where agency preservation is maintained despite optimization pressure—requiring explicit constraints that prevent sacrifice patterns from stabilizing as attractors.

## Key Concepts
- Sacrifice–Collapse Theorem (formal result)
- Non-consensual agency loss as performance enhancer
- Structural collapse of openness under optimization
- Exit suppression, conformity enforcement, dependency erosion
- Open agentic manifolds (agency-preserving regions)
- Standing asymmetry enabling sacrifice
