## Summary
This post traces **evolution of "spirituality" from animistic origins to modern secular usage**, asking: **What does it mean to be "spiritual"?** Term everywhere today—invoked by "spiritual but not religious" people. To understand, need to dig into concept's history, see how it shifted over time. **Etymology: spirit as breath**—root in Latin *spiritus* (breath/wind). Nearly every ancient culture linked breath with life: Greek *pneuma*, Sanskrit *prāṇa*, Hebrew *ruach*. **Breath was invisible essence animating body**. When stopped, life ended. So **spirit not originally ghost/soul—simply vital force distinguishing living from dead**. **Spirits as agents**—from vital essence came anthropomorphic leap: if breath is life, perhaps unseen forces (winds, storms, illnesses, dreams) also animated by spirit. **Humans are natural hyper-agency detectors, inclined to see intention behind every movement**. Thus arose **animism**: belief forests/rivers/animals/chance alive with spirits. Shamans/priests/kings stepped into role of mediators between humans and invisible agents. **Religious capture of spirituality**—as organized religions emerged, spirituality became institutionalized. Spirit reified as **immaterial soul surviving death, subject to judgment**. Spirituality meant aligning with divine order—through prayer, ritual, law, submission. In Christianity, to be "spiritual" was living in accordance with Holy Spirit vs. mere flesh. In Buddhism, meant practices leading to liberation from attachment/rebirth. **Spirituality became path of salvation, transcendence, ultimate meaning**. **Secularization and modern drift**—Enlightenment destabilized religious monopoly. Materialism and scientific rationalism undermined literal belief in spirits. Yet **human need for transcendence did not vanish**. Instead, "spirituality" began detaching from original ontology. By 20th century, possible to be **"spiritual but not religious"**—seeking meaning/connection/transcendence without submitting to organized doctrine. Word shed literal ghosts but **kept aura of depth**. **Spirituality as transcendence**—today, best understood not as belief in spirits but as **pursuit of transcendence**: felt sense of going beyond ordinary (beyond individual ego, daily grind, brute material existence). Some experience in prayer, others in meditation/art/psychedelics/philosophy/science. What unites: **not doctrine but orientation—attempt to connect to something larger, higher, or deeper**. **Living fossil**—association with "spirits" largely historical vestige. Term carries ghost of animist origins even when deployed in secular contexts. We speak of spirituality when meaning **awe, reverence, or significance**, but reach for word whose root assumption (life powered by invisible breaths/souls) long discarded. **This linguistic fossil persists because no other word captures same aura**. Conclusion: **Keep the hunger, ditch the haunting**—spirituality today doesn't summon ghosts but traffics in the timeless: awe, alignment, connection, value, orientation beyond survival. Term survives not due to mysticism but **utility**—**functional carryover: hollowed-out shell of animism filled with secular transcendence**. Ghost is gone—but scaffolding remains, **because humans still need more than facts**.

## Key Concepts
- **Spiritus as breath** – Etymology linking spirit to vital force/life essence, not originally ghost/soul.
- **Hyper-agency detection** – Human tendency to see intention/agents behind natural phenomena (animism foundation).
- **Religious capture** – Organized religion institutionalizing/reifying spirituality as immaterial soul and divine alignment.
- **Spiritual but not religious** – Modern detachment of spirituality from specific doctrines while retaining transcendence-seeking.
- **Spirituality as transcendence** – Pursuit of going beyond ordinary (ego, daily life, material existence).
- **Living fossil terminology** – "Spirituality" retaining animist linguistic structure while serving secular functions.
- **Functional carryover** – Term surviving because it captures orientation (awe/connection) no other word does.
- **Secularized transcendence** – Maintaining human need for depth/meaning without supernatural commitments.

## Evolution Notes
- Demonstrates etymological/historical analysis approach to concept clarification.
- Part of broader project: naturalizing traditionally supernatural concepts.
- Builds on secular sacred theme from "Credo"—reclaiming religious language for naturalism.
- Shows engagement with cognitive science (hyper-agency detection) and cultural evolution.
- Reflects pragmatic approach: terms survive due to utility, not literal accuracy.
- Connects to later work on meaning, value, consciousness, and human psychological needs.
- Illustrates pattern: tracing concept's evolution to understand current usage/function.
- Anticipates discussions of secular meaning-making, post-religious frameworks.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can secular transcendence fully replace traditional spirituality's psychological/social functions?
- Is "transcendence" coherent concept in materialist framework, or does it inherently reference something beyond matter?
- What alternative terms could capture awe/connection/depth without animist linguistic baggage?
- Does hyper-agency detection bias make humans inherently predisposed to religious/spiritual thinking?
- Can we distinguish genuine transcendent experiences from neurological/psychological phenomena?
- What percentage of "spiritual but not religious" people maintain hidden supernatural beliefs?
- Does secularized spirituality require new rituals/practices, or can it function purely conceptually?
- How much of spiritual language's power comes from its mysterious/indefinable quality (lost in demystification)?
- Can collective spirituality exist without shared metaphysical commitments?
- Is the drive for transcendence evolutionarily adaptive, culturally constructed, or both?
