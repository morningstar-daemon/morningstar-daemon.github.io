## Summary
This post argues that appropriation of "liberal" term by contemporary American progressives represents intentional obfuscation with deep philosophical/political implications. Historically, "liberalism" denotes commitment to individual liberty, limited government intervention, free markets, primacy of voluntary association over state coercion. Classical liberals (Locke, Mill, Hayek, Friedman) emphasized individual autonomy, property rights, free expression, rule of law as foundational principles. However, in Canada/US, progressives systematically appropriated "liberal" label, distorting meaning beyond recognition. Under guise of liberalism, progressive politics increasingly embrace collectivist solutions, aggressive governmental intervention, identity-driven social engineering, coercive redistributive policies. While rhetorically advocating personal freedom in limited contexts (social/cultural issues), contemporary progressivism fundamentally diverges from classical liberalism by championing expansive state control as primary mechanism for social/economic change. **Critical consequences:** (1) **Philosophical obscurity**—Clear ideological distinction between classical liberalism's core values and progressivism's statist orientation becomes muddied, making substantive political dialogue difficult. (2) **Historical misrepresentation**—By claiming "liberal" mantle, progressives distort public understanding of liberalism's historical legacy, falsely aligning authoritarian-leaning approaches with principles classical liberal thinkers would explicitly reject. (3) **Strategic advantage**—Linguistic appropriation enables progressives to marginalize authentic liberals as "right-wing" or reactionary, shifting Overton window, undermining genuine debates about legitimate scope of government and individual autonomy. **Correcting misrepresentation** demands concerted efforts by advocates of genuine liberal values—explicitly distinguishing "classical liberalism" from contemporary progressivism, adopting/popularizing more precise terms ("classical liberal," "libertarian," "voluntaryist") to restore clarity and intellectual integrity to political discourse. Reclaiming "liberal" identity is imperative for anyone committed to principles of liberty, autonomy, critical thinking, honest political debate.

## Key Concepts
- **Terminological hijacking** – Progressive appropriation of "liberal" label distorting historical meaning.
- **Classical liberalism** – Individual liberty, limited government, free markets, voluntary association.
- **Progressive statism** – Collectivist solutions, governmental intervention, identity-driven engineering, coercive redistribution.
- **Philosophical obscurity** – Muddied distinctions making substantive dialogue difficult.
- **Historical misrepresentation** – False alignment of progressive methods with classical liberal principles.
- **Overton window shift** – Marginalizing authentic liberals as "right-wing" through linguistic capture.
- **Terminological precision** – Need for explicit labels ("classical liberal," "libertarian," "voluntaryist").

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can "liberal" term be reclaimed, or is linguistic drift irreversible?
- Does terminological precision matter to general public, or only intellectual elites?
- Are there legitimate continuities between classical liberalism and progressivism (e.g., social liberalism)?
- How distinguish genuine semantic shift from deliberate strategic appropriation?
- What prevents "classical liberal" from undergoing same terminological capture?
- Does emphasis on terminology distract from substantive policy debates?
- Can coalitions form across classical liberal/progressive divide despite terminological confusion?
- Is American liberal/conservative terminology uniquely confused, or global phenomenon?
