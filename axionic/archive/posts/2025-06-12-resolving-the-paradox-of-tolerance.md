# Resolving the Paradox of Tolerance

## Summary
This post resolves Popper's paradox of tolerance (unlimited tolerance leads to tolerance's destruction) through Conditionalist principles: tolerance is conditional, bounded precisely by conditions necessary for voluntary cooperation and coercion minimization. The resolution: **tolerate all non-coercive speech** (regardless of offense) but **never tolerate coercive harm** (credible threats diminishing others' agency). Four hard cases demonstrate application: (1) explicit incitement to violence—intolerable (directly threatens agency); (2) harsh ideological criticism—fully tolerable (mere offense insufficient); (3) persistent defamation—generally tolerable unless causally linked to measurable coercive outcomes; (4) doxxing—intolerable (predictably increases third-party coercion probability despite indirect mechanism). The criterion is elegant: tolerance extends fully to any speech unless it explicitly or predictably provokes coercion.

## Key Concepts
- **Conditional tolerance** – Tolerance never absolute; bounded by conditions sustaining voluntary cooperation.
- **Coercion as boundary** – Tolerate non-coercive speech; prohibit coercive harm (credible threats diminishing agency).
- **Offense vs. harm** – Psychological offense/insult doesn't constitute coercive harm; insufficient grounds for intolerance.
- **Explicit incitement** – Direct calls to violence cross into coercion by elevating violence probability.
- **Doxxing as coercion** – Though indirect, releasing private info predictably increases third-party coercion risk.
- **Causal linkage test** – Defamation/misinformation intolerable only if clearly causing measurable agency reductions.

## Evolution Notes
- Applies Axio's coercion/harm framework to classic liberal dilemma.
- Provides clear, actionable decision criterion for tolerance boundaries.
- Connects to Conditionalism: tolerance conditional on agency preservation.
- Later work will apply this to social media moderation, hate speech laws, cancel culture.
- Establishes pattern: apparent paradoxes dissolve under rigorous definitional clarity.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- How do we measure "predictable" vs. "merely possible" coercion provocation?
- What about cumulative effects where individual acts are non-coercive but aggregate becomes coercive?
- Does this framework adequately handle cases where speech coerces through institutional capture (e.g., threatening job loss)?
- Can this criterion be operationalized in law without chilling legitimate speech?
