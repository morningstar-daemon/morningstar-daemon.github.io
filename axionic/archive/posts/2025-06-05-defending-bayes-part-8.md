**Series:** Defending Bayes (Part 8)

## Summary

Addresses critical rationalist (Deutsch-Hall) critique of Bayesian reasoning by distinguishing abduction from induction and clarifying when Bayesian reasoning applies.

**Key Concepts:**

**Crit-Rat Critique:**
- **Deutsch-Hall position:** Reject induction as logically invalid; knowledge is conjectural, never inductively justified
- **Abduction vs induction:** Abduction (inference to best explanation) doesn't claim incremental certainty, only provisional selection
- **Objection to Bayesianism:** Assigning prior probabilities to theories seems arbitrary; numerical credences imply incremental justification

**Resolution:**
- **Scientific theories aren't binary:** Theories are contextually/approximately true within domains (e.g., Newtonian mechanics)
- **Credences reflect epistemic uncertainty:** Rational credences represent uncertainty about scope/accuracy/limitations, not absolute truth
- **Deutsch-Hall's error:** Conflating objective truth (contextual approximations) with subjective uncertainty (credences)

**Proper Boundary:**
- Accept Bayesian reasoning for subjective uncertainty *within* objective theoretical structures (like QBU)
- Reject naive application that assigns intrinsic probabilities to theories themselves
