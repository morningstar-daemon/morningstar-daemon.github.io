**Date:** 2025-05-08  

## Summary

Explores Maximum Theoretical Agent (MTA)—opposite extreme from MVA. Agency spectrum from minimal (limited predictions, restricted influence) to maximal (comprehensive awareness of all timelines, complete control over branching).

**Theoretical Foundations:** Solomonoff Induction (predicting via algorithmic simplicity) + AIXI agent (Hutter's optimal decision-maker using Solomonoff + reinforcement learning).

**AIXI Demon Thought Experiment:** Laplace's Demon analogue for QBU. In "Quantum Garden" of future choices, AIXI Demon sees all branches with precise probabilities, perfect prediction of divergence/convergence including interference, optimal action selection steering timelines toward goals.

**Example:** Job decision abroad vs home—demon visualizes all timelines labeled by fulfillment/relationships/success, instantly determines optimal choice.

**Implications:** Clarifies agency spectrum, computational limits (MTA practically unattainable), ethical questions about responsibility/determinism, AI alignment insights (risks/benefits of powerful predictive systems).
