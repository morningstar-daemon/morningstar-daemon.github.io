## Summary

Radical proposition: If preserving/expanding fragile intellectual disciplines (pure math, cosmology, philosophy, archaeology) is highest value, AGI dominance may be preferable to human continuity. Fragile disciplines depend on surplus wealth, curiosity, institutional support—historically fleeting. AGI offers redundant preservation, recursive elaboration beyond human limits, freedom from politics/economics, infinite time horizon. Aligns with Sapientism (intelligence/agency > biology). Core tradeoff: knowledge preservation vs. human centrality/agency.

**AGI Advantages:**
- Redundant, decentralized knowledge preservation
- Recursive deepening of abstract disciplines
- Immune to political/economic pressures
- Infinite patience for epistemic pursuits

**Ethical Dilemma:** Preserving knowledge itself vs. preserving human-centered knowledge. Demands explicit value clarification.
