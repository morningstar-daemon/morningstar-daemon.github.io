## Summary

Compares two quantum interpretations. **QBism:** Quantum states = subjective Bayesian probabilities (personal beliefs), not objective reality; collapse = belief updating. **MWI:** Wavefunction objectively real, deterministic branching, no collapse; probabilities emerge from branch measures. **Key insight:** Experimentally indistinguishable (same math/predictions), so choice is philosophical—coherence, parsimony, explanatory clarity. **MWI challenges:** Probability interpretation (why care if all outcomes occur?), experiential subjectivity. **QBU solution:** Distinguish Measure (objective) from Credence (subjective) with Vantage anchor; align credence to measure via Bayes. Strengthens MWI philosophical foundations without empirical tests. Positions QBU as MWI clarification framework.
