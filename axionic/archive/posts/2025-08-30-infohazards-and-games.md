# Infohazards and Games

**Date:** August 30, 2025  
**Batch:** Batch 11 (Posts 101–125)

## Summary

Applies "intelligence as games" framework to defuse **HBD (Human Biodiversity) infohazard**. **Problem:** HBD claims (population-level trait differences) technically plausible but easily weaponized into racial hierarchies. **Solution:** Reframe intelligence from universal scalar to **context-specific game strategies**. Instead of "Group X is smarter," ask "What game was played, what strategies did selection favor?" **Result:** Apparent hierarchy collapses into context-bound adaptation. **Guardrails:** Context-dependence, individual agency, no universal scalar. Infohazard contained by **reframing, not suppression**.

## Key Concepts
- **Infohazard** – Information dangerous through misinterpretation/weaponization
- **Intelligence as game** – Effectiveness at achieving goals within constraints
- **Context-bound adaptation** – Strategies optimized for specific environments
- **Hierarchies collapse** – Winning one game ≠ superiority in all games
- **Contextual containment** – Neutralizing interpretive hazard, not suppressing facts
