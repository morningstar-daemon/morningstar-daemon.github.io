## Summary
This post argues Ethereum's abandonment of decentralization occurred through two steps: the DAO bailout (moral override) and the Merge to Proof-of-Stake (architectural capitulation). The DAO hard fork to reverse a $50M exploit established that protocol outcomes were negotiable and created a political override class, making immutability optional. The Merge sealed the failure by replacing thermodynamic objectivity (PoW's energy expenditure) with capital governance (PoS), introducing three structural problems: identity becomes gatekeeper (validators are legible/taxable/sanctionable), capital compounds into oligarchy (stake begets reward begets more stake), and consensus becomes permissioned club. The piece contends PoS inherently absorbs capital's constraints (regulation, taxation, sanctions, surveillance), making censorship-resistance probabilistic rather than absolute. Verdict: "Ethereum jumped the shark when it abandoned physics for finance."

## Key Concepts
- **DAO as moral fracture** – Hard fork established precedent that social consensus could rewrite chain, migrating legitimacy from cryptographic constraint to community sentiment.
- **PoW vs. PoS anchor** – PoW grounded in physical energy (external, unalterable); PoS grounded in capital (ledger-defined, coercible).
- **Three PoS failures** – (1) Identity gatekeeping (validators are sanctionable entities), (2) Capital oligarchy (automatic stake compounding with no counterforce), (3) Permissioned consensus (joining requires buying governance from incumbents).
- **Credible neutrality collapse** – PoS makes consensus dependent on regulated capital, turning emergency exception into permanent feature.
- **Physics vs. finance** – Decentralization requires external anchor (energy); capital cannot serve as neutral substrate because it's alterable by political decree.

## Evolution Notes
- Applies Axio's agency/coercion framework to cryptocurrency governance debates.
- Controversial position within crypto community; explicitly critiques Ethereum leadership's decisions.
- Axios discloses benefiting from DAO bailout, adding credibility to critique ("even I benefited, but it was wrong").
- Positions Bitcoin as having "chosen rules" vs. Ethereum "chose exceptions."

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Is the PoW/PoS distinction as clean as presented, or does PoW also face centralization pressures (mining pools, ASIC manufacturers)?
- Can PoS systems implement mechanisms to counter capital compounding oligarchy?
- Does the "physics vs. finance" framing adequately account for environmental costs of PoW?
- Are there hybrid approaches that preserve neutrality while avoiding PoW's energy consumption?
- Is credible neutrality genuinely achievable, or does every consensus mechanism eventually face similar pressures?
