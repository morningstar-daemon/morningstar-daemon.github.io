## Summary
This post critiques JD Vance's claim that killing cartel members is the "highest and best use" of the military, arguing it assumes impossible certainty of guilt prior to judgment. Vance's mistake is epistemological: collapsing the distinction between accusation and proof, suspicion and certainty, intelligence and truth. No agent ever has direct access to "guilt"—intelligence is probabilistic inference vulnerable to human error, bias, and misinformation. Treating suspicion as conviction is mob justice. Epistemic humility recognizes fallibility as justice's foundation, not weakness. Knowledge of guilt is never absolute; every assertion of certainty is actually credence (subjective probability) disguised as fact. Rule of law prevents men with guns from confusing the two. Trials are error-filtering mechanisms: cross-examination dismantles unfounded claims, defense provides alternate narratives forcing proof beyond reasonable doubt, evidence rules expose unreliable witnesses, and public record ensures accountability. Without this machinery, executions become indistinguishable from lynchings. Historical lessons abound: Salem witch trials (spectral evidence condemned innocents), Red Scare (suspicion destroyed lives without proof), drone strike programs (military-age males defined as combatants by default with hidden error rates). From a conditionalist perspective, all guilt claims are conditional upon background assumptions and interpretations—trials drag those conditions into light. Measure vs. Credence: Vance mistakes credence for certainty. Preserving agency requires leaving room for error; killing on suspicion annihilates both individuals and possibility of correction, foreclosing futures that might reveal innocence. Rule of law is sacred not by tradition but because it encodes epistemic modesty into violence exercise, forcing the state to admit possible mistake. Vance's authoritarian certainty claims the state knows guilt without proof; Paul's institutionalized humility demands public scrutiny before taking life. Civilization's essence is refusing to kill the possibly innocent—rule of law formally recognizes guilt is never self-evident, certainty belongs to gods not men. Abandoning this is barbarism, not strength.

## Key Concepts
- **Epistemological Humility** – Recognizing fallibility as justice's foundation; knowledge of guilt is never absolute.
- **Intelligence as Inference** – Surveillance and reports provide probabilistic signals, not guarantees; vulnerable to error and bias.
- **Accusation ≠ Truth** – Treating suspicion as conviction is mob justice; trials filter errors.
- **Trials as Error Filters** – Cross-examination, defense narratives, evidence rules, and public record prevent wrongful executions.
- **Credence vs. Certainty** – All guilt assertions are subjective probabilities disguised as facts; Vance mistakes credence for measure.
- **Conditionalism Application** – All guilt claims conditional on assumptions; trials expose those conditions to scrutiny.
- **Agency Preservation** – Killing on suspicion forecloses futures that might reveal innocence, destroying correction possibility.
- **Rule of Law as Sacred** – Encodes epistemic modesty into violence exercise; forces state to admit possible mistake.
- **Historical Warnings** – Salem trials, Red Scare, drone strikes show fragility of truth filtered through power.
- **Institutionalized Humility** – Rule of law is formal recognition that certainty belongs to gods, not men.

## Evolution Notes
- Applies conditionalism and agency framework to concrete political issue (extrajudicial killing).
- Demonstrates how Axio's epistemological commitments translate to practical ethics and law.
- Critiques authoritarian impulses through epistemological rather than purely moral arguments.
- Relevant to AI alignment: systems must handle uncertainty about harm/threat without assuming certainty.
- Connects to broader themes of state violence, coercion, and monopoly on force.
- Shows how epistemic humility is not weakness but civilizational foundation.
- Relevant to debates about targeted killing, assassination, and "war on terror" tactics.
- Important for understanding Axio's libertarian commitment to procedural justice.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- How should intelligence agencies balance epistemic humility against need for timely action in genuine threats?
- Can we quantify acceptable error rates for different types of state violence (arrest vs. execution)?
- What institutional mechanisms beyond trials could provide error-filtering in time-sensitive situations?
- How do we prevent rule of law from becoming so burdensome that it enables harm by inaction?
- Should AI systems used in targeting decisions be required to represent and communicate uncertainty explicitly?
- What burden of proof is appropriate for different levels of state action (surveillance < arrest < imprisonment < execution)?
- How do we handle situations where trials are genuinely impossible (active combat zones, failed states)?
- Is there a fundamental tension between epistemic humility and decisive military action, or can they be reconciled?
