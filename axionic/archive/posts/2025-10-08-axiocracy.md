## Summary
This foundational essay introduces "axiocracy"—a proposed governance system based on revealed preference rather than declared intention. The piece argues that democracy's reliance on words (voting, speeches) becomes inadequate as societies scale, since costless claims about values don't reflect actual commitments. Axiocracy measures belief through what people spend of money, time, attention, or effort under constraint, treating governance as continuous value discovery rather than periodic opinion polling. The essay traces governance evolution from tribes (kinship) through kingdoms (command) and democracies (speech) to markets (price) and protocols (code), positioning axiocracy as the next step: "rule by revealed value." It reframes governance as an epistemic problem of interpreting voluntary action signals rather than enforcing centralized authority. The vision concludes that as institutions learn to read choice-evidence directly, coercion becomes unnecessary and governance becomes empirical.

## Key Concepts
- **Revealed preference governance** – Measuring belief through resource allocation (money, time, attention, effort) rather than declarations.
- **Truth engines** – Systems (markets, axiocracy) that extract reliable information by requiring costly commitment rather than costless speech.
- **Governance as feedback** – Institutions functioning as adaptive networks of continuous value discovery rather than periodic authorization rituals.
- **Axiocratic evolution** – Historical progression from kinship → command → speech → price → code → revealed value systems.
- **Empirical governance** – Treating coordination as interpretation problem, observing coherence between stated ideals and actual behavior.
- **Cost as verification** – Voluntary expenditure of scarce resources as authentication mechanism for preferences.

## Evolution Notes
- Introduces the titular concept of Axio itself—the blog name is not just aesthetic but programmatic.
- Synthesizes libertarian/market reasoning with cybernetic feedback theory to propose alternative to democratic politics.
- Builds on earlier posts critiquing politics as coercion while offering positive vision of what replaces it.
- The "morality is observed, not decreed" framing connects to broader Axio naturalism about values.
- Foreshadows extensive later sequence exploring axiocratic mechanics, alignment, and implementation.
- Positions itself as evolutionary next step rather than revolutionary break—refinement, not replacement.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- How do we measure "revealed preference" for public goods that aren't excludable or for which there are no natural payment mechanisms?
- Does axiocracy risk plutocracy—those with more resources having disproportionate influence over governance outcomes?
- Can non-monetary costs (time, attention, effort) be meaningfully aggregated with monetary ones, or do they represent incommensurable value dimensions?
- What happens to populations without scarce resources to allocate (children, disabled, economically marginalized)—do they have voice in axiocracy?
- How does axiocracy handle coordination problems requiring binding commitments (climate, defense) where individual revealed preferences may be irrational?
- Is there a risk that axiocracy optimizes for easily measurable preferences while neglecting hard-to-quantify values (beauty, dignity, meaning)?
- How do we bootstrap axiocratic institutions from existing political systems without them being captured by incumbent power structures?
