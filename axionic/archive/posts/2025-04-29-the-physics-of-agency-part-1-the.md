# [The Physics of Agency, Part 1: The Physical Nature of Agency](https://axionic.org/posts/162428502.the-physics-of-agency-part-1-the.html)

**Date:** 2025-04-29  
**Series:** Physics of Agency (Part 1 of 10)

## Summary

Foundational post introducing the Physics of Agency framework. Core thesis: agency is not psychological or mystical but fundamentally physical—as rigorous and measurable as energy or entropy.

**Working Definition:** Agency is a physical process where an embedded agent with an internal model of possible futures enacts behavior that differentially amplifies specific branches of the multiverse, imposing directional structure on otherwise entropic unfolding. This "biasing of branches" requires measurable energy expenditure.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Kybits:** Fundamental units of control (analogous to Landauer's principle for information erasure)
- **Thermodynamic cost:** Every act of control requires energy
- **Branch amplification:** Agents differentially enhance probability weight in specific quantum branches

**Implications:**
- Agency is limited and finite
- Agency deteriorates without continuous energy input
- Perfect/frictionless agency is thermodynamically impossible
- True agency is an accomplishment, not an inherent property

**Series Roadmap:** Will cover formal definition of kybits, Laws of Thermodynamic Agency, interaction with quantum branching, struggle against entropy, and implications for meaning/ethics/evolution.

## Notes

- First substantive post after 2.5 year gap from announcement
- Sets up entire Physics of Agency framework that becomes central to later axionic philosophy
- Introduces kybit concept that recurs throughout archive
- Framing as "physical laws of agency" is distinctive approach vs traditional philosophy of action
