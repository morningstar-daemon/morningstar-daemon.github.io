## Summary

Classification of parasitic memes that spread at host expense. Characteristics: exploit cognitive biases, promise simple solutions, create in-group/out-group dynamics, resist falsification, demand costly loyalty displays. Examples across political/religious/ideological spectrum. Defense mechanisms: epistemic hygiene, exposure to competing ideas, meta-rationality, checking whether beliefs serve you vs you serving beliefs. Memetic immune system requires active maintenance.

## Key Concepts

- **Parasitic memes** – Ideas that spread by harming host cognition/agency
- **Infection vectors** – Cognitive biases, tribal dynamics, costly signals
- **Memetic immunity** – Active defense through epistemic hygiene and meta-rationality
