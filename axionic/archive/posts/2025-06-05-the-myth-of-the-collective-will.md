## Summary

Responds to Sean Carroll's definition of government as "organized expression of collective will." Argues collective will dissolves at scale and functions as rhetorical cover for coercion.

**Key Concepts:**

**The Scaling Problem:**
- Small groups (families, communities): Substantial overlap in values possible
- Moderate scale (thousands): Shared preferences shrink rapidly
- Large scale (cities, nations): Meaningful consensus evaporates

**Apparent vs Real Consensus:**
- Abstract concepts ("fairness," "freedom," "prosperity") garner superficial agreement
- Practical interpretations fracture immediately upon specific application
- Even "universal principles" fail consensus tests for concrete policy

**The Illusion:**
- "Collective will" functions as rhetorical cover for authority
- Not genuine reflection of unanimous or widespread agreement
- Obscures fundamentally coercive nature of governmental power

**Reality of Governance:**
- Inherently involves coercion and compromise
- Relies on majority or elite preferences
- Legitimacy claims based on mythical collective will demand skepticism
