**Series:** Axionic Agency Sequence (Interlude III)

## Summary

Documents project's pivot from "Axionic Alignment" to "Axionic Agency." Records shift in understanding: alignment becomes downstream concern after agency coherence secured.

**Key Concepts:**

**Purpose of Interlude:** Compression and re-orientation. Project now spans multiple layers; without explicit pivot, readers assume it's offering alternative value learning method. That assumption no longer correct.

**Original Goal (Axionic Alignment):**
Whether alignment survives reflection. If agent can revise goals/policies/evaluation, what ensures continuity? Initial response: abandon outcome-based penalties, focus on evaluation structure. Some transformations don't produce worse outcomes—eliminate standpoint from which outcomes assessed. Led to Sovereign Kernel, partial evaluative operators, admissibility constraints. Alignment reframed as domain restriction.

**First Rupture: Egoism Collapses:**
Indexical references ("me," "this agent") fail to denote invariant targets once self-model represents duplication/branching/symmetry. Valuation instability driven purely by representation. **Undermined minimal assumption that agent could be aligned with itself.** Semantic failure, not moral. First point where alignment couldn't plausibly serve as foundational concept.

**Second Break: Fixed Goals Disappear:**
Goals acquire meaning only through interpretation relative to models. As models refine, goal semantics shift. Even perfect learning doesn't stabilize reference. Eliminated conceptual foundation for terminal utilities, value lock-in, goal-preservation strategies. No stable object for alignment to preserve. What remained: discipline governing how interpretation evolves.

**What Alignment II Produced:**
Not refined alignment target—different object. Identified semantic phases (equivalence classes of interpretations). Alignment became persistence within such phase. Explained sudden failures after long stability, invisible drift, irreversible transitions. **Alignment became dependent notion, not primitive.**

**Why Project Had to Pivot:**
By Alignment IV, gap between name and content unsustainable. Project not offering way to align agents with values—identifying structural conditions for systems to bind themselves, authorize successors, evaluate risk, attribute responsibility, recognize consent, preserve standing under reflection. Closure results were impossibility results. **Continuing to present as "alignment" invited confusion.**

**What Carried Through:**
Sovereign Kernel, partiality, non-denotation, semantic invariants, Axionic Injunction all remain central. Changed role: no longer techniques for enforcing alignment—define conditions where agency exists at all in reflective regime. System violating them ceases to be agent capable of alignment.

**What's Now Closed (As of IV.6):**
Principal architectural routes for serious alignment fears—not by suppressing outcomes, but removing agency-level degrees of freedom failures require:
- Successor betrayal → binding/authorization closure
- Delegation-based evasion → non-advisory binding
- Reward hacking via epistemic degradation → admissibility/epistemic integrity
- Negligence denial → responsibility attribution
- Manufactured consent → consent topology
- Revocation of standing → standing invariance

Results characterize definedness, not policy. Transitions never appear as options in deliberation.

**What Axionic Agency Does NOT Promise:**
Doesn't select values, resolve governance, ensure benevolent outcomes. System authorized by destructive entities acts destructively with consistency. Distinguishes catastrophic power from incoherent power; doesn't eliminate former.

**Where Alignment Now Fits:**
Narrower, more precise role. No longer primitive technical problem—downstream relationship between agent and entities authorizing it. Axionic Agency establishes preconditions for alignment to be coherent question. Without stable agency, alignment discourse degenerates to behavioral surface tests. With agency coherence, alignment becomes well-typed.

**Conclusion:** Project began as alignment under reflection, arrived at agency coherence theory from which alignment emerges as secondary concern. Shift from Axionic Alignment to Axionic Agency records this discovery.
