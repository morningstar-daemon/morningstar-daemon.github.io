# When Plunder Funds Physics

**Date:** 2025-06-06  

## Summary

Provocative critique of government-funded science using Bastiat's framework of legalized plunder. Responds to Sean Carroll's concerns about federal research cuts.

**Key Concepts:**

**The Plunder Framework:**
- State as "great fiction by which everyone tries to live at the expense of everyone else" (Bastiat)
- Science funding = organized extraction, moralized through cultural prestige
- Scientists form coalitions to lobby for larger share of coerced funding

**Carroll's Position:**
- Views federal research cuts as cultural/civilizational loss
- Imagines state as neutral steward of progress
- Feels aggrieved when funding cut—but objection is factional, not anti-coercion

**The Deeper Critique:**
- "Public good" claims are lobbying, not neutral observation
- Scientists asserting their values (curiosity, discovery) should override others'
- Even Enlightenment can be co-opted to justify organized theft
- Value system requiring guns isn't enlightenment—"just a cleaner pasture"

**Voluntary Alternatives Already Exist:**
- Crowdfunded research
- Open-source data
- Voluntary patronage
- DAOs funding basic research through decentralized grants
- "Working prototypes of post-coercive epistemology"

**Metaphor:** The cow cartoon—those who benefit from the system dismissing warnings as "conspiracy theory"

## Notes

- Highly provocative framing—compares scientists to other rent-seekers

- Published day after June 5 burst—sustained high output period
- Demonstrates willingness to alienate academic audience with radical libertarian critique
- Proposes concrete voluntary alternatives, not just critique
