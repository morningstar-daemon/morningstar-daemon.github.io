**Series:** Physics of Agency (Part 4 of 10)

## Summary

Establishes first thermodynamic law of agency: exercising control requires physical work proportional to kybits exerted.

**Formal Statement:** E_min = C × k × T × ln(2)
- C = number of kybits exerted
- k = Boltzmann's constant
- T = temperature
- ln(2) = binary nature of kybits

**Key Principle:** Agency is never free. Each deliberate action to influence future possibilities consumes real physical resources.

**Drift vs Control:**
- Drift = spontaneous entropic evolution (no effort required)
- Control = intentional energy investment to move against entropy

Greater control (more kybits) = greater thermodynamic cost.

**Real-World Examples:**
- AI drone adjusting flight path based on predictions
- Investment algorithm managing portfolio
- Animal storing food based on environmental cues

All involve predictive models + energy expenditure to shape future outcomes.
