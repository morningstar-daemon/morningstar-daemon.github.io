## Summary
Explores Brian Klaas's thesis in *Fluke* that tiny differences inevitably produce radically divergent futures, connecting to Quantum Branching Universe (QBU) theory. Most people believe small decisions occasionally have profound consequences but treat these as rare exceptions. Klaas asserts tiny differences don't just occasionally matter—they necessarily and inevitably produce radically divergent futures. Historical example: Drake's 1579 West Coast journey missed San Francisco Bay entrance due to fog; if fog cleared, English colonization might have begun centuries earlier, reshaping geopolitics. Trivial detail (fog presence) shapes global history. Michael Shermer interview demonstrates common misconception—acknowledged argument but intuitively believes most small differences have little long-term impact, subscribing to "rubber-band" model where perturbations return to equilibrium. QBU formalizes Klaas: minuscule quantum-level differences lead to branching timelines inevitably diverging. Initially unnoticeable, microscopic distinctions compound exponentially; within weeks/months/years, timelines become unrecognizably different. Everyday example: crossing street immediately vs. waiting 2 seconds—initially indistinguishable, but cascades through encounters, conversations, opportunities. Amplifies into radically different futures. Implications for agency: every choice, no matter how trivial, significantly shapes measure (objective quantum probability) of futures. "Your actions matter profoundly not just in rare, special cases, but always and everywhere."
