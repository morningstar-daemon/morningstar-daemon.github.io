## Summary

Wealth is morally neutral; its value derives from deployment. Productive deployment (innovation, infrastructure, capability-building) vs consumerist entropy. Critiques both anti-wealth moralizing and thoughtless consumption. Defends affluence when it funds expansion, agency-enhancement, existential risk reduction. Obligation isn't redistribution but wise channeling.

## Key Concepts

- **Deployment ethics** – Value of wealth determined by use, not possession
- **Productive vs entropic** – Innovation/infrastructure vs consumption/waste
- **Channeling obligation** – Responsibility to deploy wealth for leverage, not merely enjoy or redistribute
