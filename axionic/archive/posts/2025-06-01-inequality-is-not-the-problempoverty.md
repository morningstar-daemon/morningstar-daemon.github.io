# [Inequality Is Not the Problem—Poverty Is](https://axionic.org/posts/164947886.inequality-is-not-the-problempoverty.html)

**Date:** 2025-06-01  

## Summary

Challenges the common focus on inequality reduction in favor of poverty alleviation. Core argument: disparity in wealth doesn't inherently cause harm—absolute deprivation does.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Harm from deprivation, not disparity:** A billionaire and millionaire coexisting don't harm each other through their wealth gap; each retains full agency
- **Poverty as agency constraint:** Real harm comes from lacking resources necessary for meaningful choice and action
- **Coercive redistribution:** Policies aimed at reducing inequality through force create new harm by reducing agency of those compelled to give
- **Voluntary poverty alleviation:** Agent-respecting approaches address deprivation without imposing coercion

**Central Claim:** Inequality measures difference; poverty measures deprivation. Only the latter inherently constrains agency and causes harm.
