## Summary

Deepens "Evolution is All You Need" by framing human creativity as **multi-layered virtual evolution** grounded in quantum determinism. **Ideas = virtual patterns** (neural attractors) evolving rapidly without physical constraints. **Nested selection:** (1) Unconscious variation (stochastic neural firings, recombinations), (2) Unconscious selection (predictive coding, free-energy minimization), (3) Preconscious filtering (emotional resonance, intuition), (4) Conscious evaluation (explicit reasoning). **Quantum foundations:** MWI branching provides micro-scale variation; neural architecture acts as amplifier/filter, constraining which quantum fluctuations manifest as ideas. Not "every brain explores every idea"—neural constraints shape explored subset. **Virtual > genetic evolution:** Faster, more flexible, dynamically adjustable goals. **Evidence:** Neuroscience (DMN, predictive processing), AI (transformers, GANs). Positions creativity as quantum-grounded, neurally-constrained evolutionary process.
