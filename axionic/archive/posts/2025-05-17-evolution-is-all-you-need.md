**Date:** 2025-05-17  

## Summary

Argues creativity = evolution (variation + selection), responding to Deutsch/Hall's "open-endedness" objection. **Core claim:** Randomness (variation) + purposeful selection = creativity; not mysterious. Critics say simulations fail to replicate open-ended evolution, but this is computational complexity, not conceptual gap. **Open-endedness explained:** Emerges naturally from recursive multi-level evolution with dynamic fitness landscapes—earlier solutions create new selective pressures. Examples: AlphaGo, GANs, Avida show partial open-endedness. **Conclusion:** Evolution conceptually complete for explaining creativity; simulation difficulty ≠ theoretical incompleteness. Defends evolutionary epistemology against Deutschian critique.
