## Summary
This post uses the U.S. Trinidad strike (destroying a suspected drug-smuggling boat without warning, then killing survivors) as a case study demonstrating that "no one is above the law" is an aspirational myth rather than reality. Law functions as coordination technology that binds only where enforcement capacity exists—when one actor possesses overwhelming reach and escape from reciprocal constraint, rules lose operational force. The strike reveals geopolitical topology: power concentrated beyond the reach of consequence. The post treats impunity not as moral outrage but as diagnostic, revealing where enforcement circuits are dead and corrective forces cannot reach.

## Key Concepts
- **Law as coordination technology** – Rules work only when agents stand in balanced positions; when power becomes unilateral, enforcement collapses.
- **Effective vs written law** – Distinction between articulated rules and operational enforcement; rules remain written but circuits are dead.
- **Structural impunity** – Position where reciprocal constraints cannot reach, not mere privilege but geometric fact of power distribution.
- **Impunity as diagnostic** – Reveals enforcement capacity limits, where coercive authority escapes feedback, where future harms accumulate.
- **Architectural remedy** – Political systems must be built so no power concentration can detach from consequence.

## Evolution Notes
- Applies Axio's structural analysis to international relations, avoiding moralistic framing.
- Shows how apparent moral failures are often mechanical: system lacks capacity to impose consequences.
- Links to Axiocracy's vision of reciprocal-constraint architecture.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- What institutional mechanisms could create reciprocal constraint on hegemonic powers without requiring their consent?
- Can international law evolve enforcement capacity, or is structural impunity inevitable for sufficiently powerful actors?
- What incentives would motivate powerful states to submit to genuine reciprocal constraint?
