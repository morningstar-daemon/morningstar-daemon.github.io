## Summary

Agency operates by shifting measure across quantum branches—choosing actions that amplify desired futures in the multiverse. Not selecting single timeline but reshaping probability distribution. Combines QBU framework with decision theory: agents are measure-redirecting processes. Implications for ethics (maximize measure of valuable branches), free will (compatibilist account via branch amplification), and meaning (agency as fundamental physical process).

## Key Concepts

- **Measure shifting** – Agency as process redistributing amplitude/probability across Everettian branches
- **Branch amplification** – Actions that increase measure of preferred outcome-spaces
- **Measure ethics** – Maximize total measure of valuable branches, not just local outcomes
