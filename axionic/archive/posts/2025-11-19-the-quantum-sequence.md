**Series:** Quantum Sequence (Announcement/Index)

## Summary

Major sequence announcement introducing QBU framework in detail. Indexes 20 posts developing formal machinery for understanding reality as branching quantum timelines.

**Key Concepts:**

**Core Theme:** Branching replaces mystery with structure; probability becomes relation between Measure and Credence; agency becomes art of steering amplitude.

**Formal Machinery Introduced:**
- Measure (objective probability)
- Vantage (temporal perspective)
- Branchcones (accessible futures/pasts)
- Pattern Identifiers (Strong/Weak—selecting timelines)

**Sequence Structure (20 Posts):**

**Foundations:**
1. QBU as DAG of quantum events
2. Strong vs Weak Pattern Identifiers
3. Rigorous definition of causality
4. Quantum Agency (QDT + Thermodynamic Laws)
5. Core conceptual toolkit

**Interpretations:**
6. QBism vs Many Worlds
7. Gigaplex of parallel lives (identity)
8. Heads or Tails (Measure vs Credence)

**Causation & Semantics:**
9. Do Ideas Move Atoms? (semantic causation)
10. Probabilities to counterfactuals (real branches)
11. Observer Class Alignment (shared basis)

**Randomness:**
12. Randomness and Determinism (epistemic vs structural)
13. Quantum Foundations of Daily Chaos
14. Quantum Chess (neural fluctuations)
15. Everett's Demon (vs Laplace's demon)

**Decision Theory & Ethics:**
16. Probability Without Collapse (Born rule)
17. Navigating the Multiverse (ethics as amplitude navigation)
18. Quantum Free Will (conditional identification)
19. Quantum Local Realism (Raymond-Robichaud model)
20. Quantum Realism Is Inevitable (structural realism)

## Notes

- Published November 19—same day as Cybernetics Sequence
- Major systematic presentation of QBU framework
- Most comprehensive sequence in archive to this point
- Integrates multiple themes: physics, ethics, decision theory, consciousness
- Gap from June 10 to November 19 suggests focused work on sequences
- Foundation for much of later axionic philosophy
