## Summary

First in 5-part series defending Bayesian epistemology within QBU against Deutsch/Hall objections. **Core argument:** Bayes' theorem rigorously applicable in QBU—Measures (objective quantum probabilities) serve as analogs to classical probabilities; conditional Measures well-defined via Pattern Identifiers. **Deutsch/Hall critique:** Bayesianism misrepresents science (probabilistic confirmation vs explanatory innovation); credence has no role. **Response:** Two knowledge categories: (1) Explanatory (scientific theories, non-probabilistic, accepted via criticism), (2) Empirical/predictive (specific facts/outcomes within frameworks, legitimate credence domain). **Conclusion:** Bayes is "best and only coherent method" for aligning subjective Credence with objective Measure—complements, doesn't compete with, explanatory knowledge.

## Notes

- Begins major epistemological sequence
- Engages Deutsch/Hall directly, charitably
- Strong claims ("only coherent method")
- Foundation for subsequent refinements
