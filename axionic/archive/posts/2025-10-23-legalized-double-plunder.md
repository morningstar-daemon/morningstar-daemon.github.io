## Summary
Analyzes modern states' fiscal alchemy: taxation (overt plunder) + inflation (covert plunder). Inflation as hidden tax—devaluing currency to fund deficit spending. Double extraction from citizens. Core insight: Fiat currency enables states to plunder twice—once through taxation, again through monetary debasement.
