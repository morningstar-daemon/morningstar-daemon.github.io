## Summary
This post argues inequality is distributional description not harm; conflating them replaces causal analysis with moralized snapshots. Key distinction: inequality is static, agency is dynamic. What matters is not position at time t but whether alternative futures remain reachable. Two societies with identical Gini coefficients feel radically different if one has open paths (high variance, mobility preserved) vs frozen positions (agency destroyed). Meta-analysis showing no reliable inequality-well-being link unsurprising: humans adapt to rank differences but not foreclosed possibility. Psychological distress correlates with loss of control/optionality/stagnation (immobility features) not inequality per se. Causal chain: coercive authority enables capture → mobility collapses → persistent inequality emerges (symptom not cause). Without coercive gatekeeping, wealth cannot enforce stasis. Competition selects among paths (compatible with agency); coercion removes them (harm). Taleb's "skin in the game" insight: exposure to risk forces attention on trajectories not snapshots; inequality discourse dominated by insulated classes mistaking positional comparison for moral insight. Axio treats harm as agency reduction—contraction of reachable futures. Moral question: are futures open? Society preserving mobility tolerates inequality; society suppressing mobility cannot tolerate even perfect equality.

## Key Concepts
- **Inequality vs immobility** – Static distributional description vs dynamic agency constraint; only latter constitutes harm.
- **Open paths vs frozen positions** – High variance with mobility preserves agency; equality with stasis destroys it.
- **Foreclosed possibility** – Humans adapt to rank differences but not to blocked futures; distress from immobility not disparity.
- **Causal reversal** – Coercive institutions freeze ladders enabling capture; inequality is symptom not driver.
- **Competition vs coercion** – Competition selects among paths (agency-compatible); coercion removes paths (harm).
- **Skin in the game** – Exposure to risk filters for trajectory-focus vs snapshot-moralizing.
- **Agency lens** – Harm is reachable-future contraction; inequality matters only insofar as it reflects/contributes to blocked transitions.

## Evolution Notes
- Responds to Nature meta-analysis on inequality-wellbeing disconnect.
- Clarifies Axio harm definition: agency reduction not distributional pattern.
- Distinguishes agency-preserving variance from coercion-enforced immobility.
- Dissolves confusion why inequality can rise without decay or equalization coincide with despair.
- Connects to broader theme: optimization of surface metrics while shrinking future-access.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- How do we measure mobility/future-access operationally without collapsing into snapshot metrics?
- Can societies maintain open paths under extreme resource concentration without coercive capture becoming inevitable?
- What distinguishes legitimate barriers (skill requirements) from coercive gatekeeping?
- How does identity horizon interact with mobility—if populations rapidly replace, does trajectory-focus make sense?
- Is there minimum variance necessary for meaningful mobility, or can flat distributions preserve agency?
- Can redistribution schemes preserve/enhance mobility, or do they inherently trade path-access for outcome-flattening?
