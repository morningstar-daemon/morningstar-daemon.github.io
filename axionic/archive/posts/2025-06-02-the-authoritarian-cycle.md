## Summary

**Why do political actors abandon liberal principles upon gaining power?** Many claim to champion free speech, autonomy, tolerance—yet abandon them in power. **Explanation**: Political groups invoke principles instrumentally. When out of power, universal liberal values = advantageous tools (building alliances, winning sympathy). Upon gaining authority, same values = obstacles (restrict ability to enact policies, silence opposition). **Out of power**: Advocating universally appealing liberal principles helps form broad coalitions against incumbents. **In power**: Priorities shift from coalition-building to coalition-maintenance → restrict previously championed liberties to advance narrower interests. **Both left and right demonstrate cycle.** Left (historically free expression champions) frequently embrace censorship when holding institutional power ("combat harmful ideas"). Right (limited government professing) adopt authoritarian measures when dominant ("social stability," "national security"). **True principled behavior inherently costly**: Demands sacrificing expediency, enduring discomfort, tolerating dissent. Genuine principled actors rare yet indispensable. **Without principled centrists/liberals**: Political landscapes devolve into competing authoritarianisms (each justifying abuses by citing opponents' excesses). Principled actors provide stability, reduce friction, uphold accountability/transparency norms. **Breaking cycle requires**: Valuing principles as terminal goals, not merely instrumental tactics. Only then can stable liberal order persist beyond power cycles.
