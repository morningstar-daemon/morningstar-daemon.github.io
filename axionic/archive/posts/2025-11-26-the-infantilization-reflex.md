## Summary
This post critiques the pattern where adult women are granted full agency except when romantic choices violate egalitarian expectations, at which point they're reframed as "fragile ingénues misled by cunning older men." Axios calls this the "infantilization reflex"—a cultural maneuver that selectively withdraws agency when choices conflict with ideological commitments. The piece argues this is logically inconsistent: women in their twenties are trusted with high-stakes decisions (voting, contracts, medical sovereignty, parenthood) but not mate choice if it involves age/status differentials. Axios attributes this to hidden incentives (intrasexual competition, status preservation, moral consistency maintenance) and argues the reflex reveals culture's inability to acknowledge autonomous non-egalitarian sexual preferences. The Axio position: agency is structural and embodied, not context-dependent and revocable.

## Key Concepts
- **Infantilization reflex** – Granting agency when choices align with norms, withdrawing it when choices conflict with ideology or status interests.
- **Selective nullification** – The logical inconsistency of trusting women with all high-stakes decisions except romantic ones that trigger narrative disapproval.
- **Protection as political technology** – How vulnerability narratives justify moral intervention and relationship regulation rather than safeguarding genuine autonomy.
- **Empowerment vs. paternalism contradiction** – The incompatibility between treating women as empowered moral subjects and recoding them as passive recipients of male influence.
- **Hidden incentives** – Intrasexual competition (older women), status preservation (lower-status men), moral consistency maintenance (egalitarian ideology vs. hypergamy reality).
- **Agency without exceptions** – The principle that adults are responsible for their choices; carving out exemptions for ideologically uncomfortable outcomes is paternalism.

## Evolution Notes
- Represents Axios's most explicit engagement with gender politics and sexual selection dynamics.
- Applies agency framework to controversial domain, testing its consistency under ideological pressure.
- The evolutionary psychology framing (reproductive/mate-choice leverage, hypergamy) positions Axio outside purely constructivist gender theory.
- Likely to be contentious; directly challenges progressive narratives about age-gap relationships and "power imbalances."

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can the framework distinguish between genuine coercion and consensual choices that happen to involve power asymmetries?
- Does the evolutionary psychology framing adequately account for cultural variation in mate preferences?
- What institutional responses to predatory behavior are compatible with respecting adult agency?
- Is there a coherent middle position between "all choices are equally autonomous" and "agency is conditional on ideological approval"?
