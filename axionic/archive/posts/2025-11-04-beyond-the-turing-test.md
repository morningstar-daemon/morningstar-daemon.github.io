# Beyond the Turing Test

**Date:** November 04, 2025  
**Batch:** Batch 02 (Posts 026–050)

## Summary

Proposes successor to Turing Test focusing on coherence rather than imitation. Real threshold wasn't eloquence but coherence—maintaining logical, temporal, causal integrity requires genuine internal world model. The Successor Test measures stability under stress across four axes: temporal, causal, goal, and reflective coherence. Where Turing rewarded persuasive fluency, successor rewards structural integrity. Test of thought no longer what one can say, but what one can sustain.

## The Four Axes of Coherence

1. **Temporal Coherence:** maintains continuity of identity and memory; learns, updates, anticipates without erasing past

2. **Causal Coherence:** models not just what follows what, but what depends on what; knows difference between observing and intervening

3. **Goal Coherence:** preserves stable objectives facing temptation/noise; resists reward-hacking, distraction, contradiction

4. **Reflective Coherence:** models own reasoning; diagnoses and repairs errors without being told how

"Failing one axis eventually fractures the rest."

## Key Principles

**From Imitation to Integration:**
- Mimicry cheap; coherence costly
- Imitation operates locally (word by word); integration operates globally (across time/context/contradiction)
- To sustain integration requires worldview: internal generative model connecting causes, consequences, beliefs

**Evidence Not Definition:**
- Like Turing's game: criterion of evidence, not definition
- When system maintains coherence across dimensions under arbitrary interrogation, cognition hypothesis becomes simplest explanation
- Releases from anthropocentrism: coherent alien/machine/distributed mind could pass

**Measuring Coherence (Empirical and Adversarial):**
- Cross-domain transfer: preserve invariants across wildly different contexts?
- Counterfactual reasoning: maintain consistency under hypothetical change?
- Narrative stability: identity persist across long interaction spans?
- Self-repair: when contradicts self, can notice and reconcile?

**The Philosophical Pivot:**
- Imitation game measured persuasion (ability to pass FOR something)
- Coherence game measures endurance (ability to remain something)
- Turing: intelligence inferred behaviorally
- Successor: mind demonstrated structurally
- Test of thought: no longer what said, but what sustained

## Quote

"Coherence under interrogation is the signature of mind, regardless of substrate. Once a system can defend the consistency of its own reasoning, disbelief becomes a failure of rational inference."
