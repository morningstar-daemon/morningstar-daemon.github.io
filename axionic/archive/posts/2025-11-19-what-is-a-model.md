**Series:** Cybernetics Sequence

## Summary

Foundational conceptual clarification defining models across scientific, cognitive, and cybernetic contexts. Part of Cybernetics Sequence establishing that understanding and control require models.

**Key Concepts:**

**Core Definition:** A model is a structured representation of some domain that preserves distinctions and relations relevant to particular explanatory or regulatory task.

**Essential Features:**
- **Not resemblance:** Must encode structure to support correct inferences, not visual/material similarity
- **Abstraction:** Preserves relevant features, abstracts away irrelevant detail
- **Purpose-relative:** Adequacy always relative to task (prediction, control, explanation)

**Forms of Models:**
- Mathematical formulations (Newtonian mechanics)
- Computational simulations
- State-transition systems
- Statistical/probabilistic models
- Neural representations
- Conceptual frameworks

**Implicit vs Explicit:**
- **Implicit:** Embodied in biological structure (enzyme pathways, neural circuits)
- **Explicit:** Deliberately constructed (theories, simulations, frameworks)

**Generative Structure:**
Defining feature: generates expectations. Maps inputs to outputs, enabling prediction and explanation. Distinguishes models from mere observation lists.

**Compression & Generalization:**
Models often compress information, capturing regularities compactly. Enables generalization to novel cases. (Lookup tables = minimal models without compression)

**Interpretive Role:**
Attributing beliefs/desires/intentions = constructing model of agent's behavior. Different representational layer than agent's own regulatory architecture.

**In Axio Framework:**
- Conditionalism: All empirical claims conditional on background models
- QBU: Uses models to define vantage, measure, expectation
- Agency: Models enable coherent action within environments
