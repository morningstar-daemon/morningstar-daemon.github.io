## Summary

Integrates Karl Friston's Active Inference (Variational Free-Energy Principle) with the Three Thermodynamic Laws of Agency. **Law 1 (Control Work):** Kybits correspond to precision-weighted prediction errors that agents minimize through active inference—informational complexity = physical work. **Law 2 (Agency Decay):** Agents require ongoing energetic/informational exchange to minimize free energy; isolation leads to prediction error accumulation and model degradation. **Law 3 (Agency Limits):** Perfect free-energy minimization impossible due to inherent uncertainty, noise, and model inaccuracies—residual errors are unavoidable. Synthesis: agency = continuous predictive control constrained by thermodynamic reality. Positions Active Inference as compatible framework for axionic physics of agency.
