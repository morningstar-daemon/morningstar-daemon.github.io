## Summary
This post introduces **Physics Engineering** as a radical paradigm shift from viewing physics as passive discovery of fixed natural laws to active co-creation of physical reality through informational coherence selection. Traditional physics assumes an objectively existing external universe governed by immutable laws that scientists merely uncover through observation and experiment. Axio rejects this framework, building on the "infinite randomness" cosmology where reality emerges from informational coherence patterns filtered from quantum chaos. If physical laws are not externally fixed but arise from coherence selection, then **humans can deliberately choose or construct informational conditions that yield desired physical behaviors**—transforming physics from descriptive to prescriptive science. The process: (1) define desired physical outcomes, (2) identify minimal informational coherence conditions necessary, (3) implement computational substrates embodying these constraints, (4) allow physical realities to emerge directly from these informational selections. This reframes humanity's relationship to the physical world: from discovery to **co-creation** of fundamental laws; from constrained operation within fixed reality to **unlimited creative potential** engineering novel phenomena, exotic fields, alternative cosmological constants; from assuming unique external determination to embracing **ontological flexibility** where physical laws are explicitly selectable from infinite informational possibilities. Practical applications (currently theoretical): engineering novel quantum states for technology, designing exotic spacetime structures, choosing alternative cosmological constants for investigation. Challenges include precisely defining/instantiating coherence constraints, developing computational frameworks to realize them, ensuring internal consistency in complex engineered realities. The post's style is notable—excessive use of "explicitly" throughout, perhaps signaling careful philosophical positioning or stylistic experiment. Philosophically, this is deeply constructivist/idealist: reality not as discovered but *made*, with humans as ontological architects rather than epistemic explorers. Represents culmination of Axio's information-theoretic worldview, where computation precedes physics, and consciousness/agency become cosmologically fundamental.

## Key Concepts
- **Physics engineering** – Deliberately constructing informational coherence conditions to create desired physical laws/behaviors.
- **From discovery to co-creation** – Paradigm shift from passive observation to active reality construction.
- **Informational coherence** – Patterns of information that, when instantiated, give rise to physical laws and phenomena.
- **Prescriptive physics** – Physics as participatory science where laws are selected/created, not merely described.
- **Ontological flexibility** – Physical laws are not uniquely determined externally but selectable from infinite possibilities.
- **Computational substrate** – Framework implementing informational constraints from which physics emerges.
- **Infinite randomness cosmology** – Background framework where reality emerges from quantum chaos via coherence filtering.
- **Reality as construct** – Physical laws as results of human/conscious selection rather than external givens.

## Evolution Notes
- Builds directly on "Infinite Randomness and QFT" series—assumes that framework as foundation.
- Represents radicalization of information-theoretic physics (Wheeler's "it from bit" taken to extreme).
- Connects to Constructor Theory (Deutsch/Marletto)—focus on what transformations are possible.
- Aligns with simulation hypothesis implications—if reality is computational, it's potentially editable.
- Philosophical debt to idealism (Berkeley, Kant), pragmatism (James), constructivism.
- Anticipates later work on agency, sovereignty, axionic architecture—if we engineer physics, we engineer possibility space for agency.
- Reflects transhumanist/extropian ambitions—radical transformation of fundamental reality itself.
- May be responding to existential risk discourse—if current physics permits catastrophic outcomes, engineer different physics.
- Style note: Excessive "explicitly" use suggests careful philosophical positioning, avoiding implicit claims.
- Part of pattern: Axio pushing philosophical ideas toward practical/technological implementation.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Is physics engineering metaphorically provocative or literally proposing we'll engineer physical laws?
- What computational resources would be required to instantiate coherence conditions yielding novel physics?
- Does this require simulation hypothesis to be true, or can it work in "base reality"?
- How distinguish "engineering coherence that yields physics" from "simulating physics within existing physics"?
- If multiple agents engineer conflicting coherence conditions, which reality wins? Is there meta-physics?
- Does this solve or worsen existential risk—can malicious actors engineer catastrophic physics?
- Is there ethical framework for deciding which physical laws to engineer? Who decides?
- How does this relate to multiverse/many-worlds—are we already in all possible physics, just selecting our branch?
- Can consciousness itself be "engineered" through physics engineering, or does it transcend physical laws?
- Is excessive "explicitly" linguistic tic, deliberate rhetorical strategy, or symptom of uncertainty?
- Does physics engineering imply reality is fundamentally subjective/mental rather than objective/physical?
