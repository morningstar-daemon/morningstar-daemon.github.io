## Summary
This essay explores the implications of many-worlds quantum mechanics for agency, probability, and ethics. Opening with the question of "hoping" to see the AI singularity, it argues that if the wavefunction never collapses, every possible future already exists—the question is not whether you'll experience it but "how much of you" will. Future selves are not singular threads but measure-weighted subsets of the universal wavefunction descended from your current pattern. Uncertainty becomes self-locational rather than ontological: you're not predicting which future exists (they all do) but where within the branching structure you'll find yourself. Agency transforms into "measure modulation"—you can't eliminate branches but can bias the amplitude distribution of your continuations toward flourishing. The essay concludes that ethics becomes amplitude allocation: moral acts thicken the measure of flourishing branches, while destructive acts amplify suffering. Living rationally is engineering the measure distribution of continuations.

## Key Concepts
- **Measure-weighted continuations** – Future selves are not singular but diffuse across branching possibilities with varying amplitude densities.
- **Self-locational uncertainty** – Uncertainty is not about which futures exist (all do) but about which branch your next moment of experience inhabits.
- **Measure modulation** – Agency as the capacity to influence amplitude distribution across descendant branches, not to eliminate possibilities.
- **Amplitude allocation ethics** – Moral significance persists through shaping the measure-weighted distribution of flourishing versus suffering.
- **Continuity engineering** – Rational living as deliberately biasing measure toward desirable futures (e.g., surviving to positive singularity).

## Evolution Notes
- Deepens Axio's quantum foundations, moving from abstract many-worlds physics to concrete implications for decision-making and ethics.
- Transforms the Physics of Agency framework into quantum measure theory: agency is not timeline selection but amplitude engineering.
- Resolves the apparent tension between determinism (all futures exist) and responsibility (your choices still matter via measure distribution).
- The suicide example as "measure annihilation" provides a stark illustration of agency's physical reality.
- Foreshadows later technical work on quantum agency and the coherence criterion for consciousness.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- How do we empirically measure or estimate the amplitude distribution of our continuations? Is this forever epistemic or potentially measurable?
- Does measure modulation require quantum coherence at macroscopic scales, or does classical approximation suffice for practical agency?
- What is the relationship between measure density and subjective experience intensity? Are "thicker" branches more vividly experienced?
- If all possibilities happen, does the concept of "regret" make sense? Can you regret outcomes that necessarily occur somewhere?
- How does measure modulation interact with coordination problems—can groups collectively engineer shared measure distributions?
- Does this framework imply that highly improbable but positive outcomes (miracle branches) always exist, and if so, what are the implications for hope and despair?
