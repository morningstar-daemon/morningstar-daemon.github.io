# [Identifying Branches in the QBU](https://axionic.org/posts/162845671.identifying-branches-in-the-qbu.html)

## Summary

Explores Pattern Identifiers (PIs) in Quantum Branching Universe framework using concrete examples: genotype vs name.

**Strong PI Example: Genotype**
- Uniquely identifies individual at biological level
- All timelines with exact genotype share common ancestor (fertilization/genetic recombination)
- Implication: Can trace back to clearly defined causal event
- Use: Ideal for rigorous causality/agency investigations

**Weak PI Example: Personal Name**
- Culturally assigned identifier, lacks biological/causal constraints
- Timelines with same name don't necessarily share common ancestor
- Same name may independently arise in separate causal histories
- Implication: Selected timelines may include unrelated individuals, no shared causal root
- Use: Broader cultural/historical analysis, not suitable for rigorous causal identification

**Why Distinction Matters:** Strong PIs provide robust causal anchors essential for analyzing agency, decision-making, choice. Weak PIs support broader discussions without precise causal guarantees.

**Operational Significance:** Maintaining rigor in QBU framework requires distinguishing these types for proper analysis of choices and events.

## Notes

- Technical refinement of QBU framework
- Genotype as Strong PI recurs in identity discussions
- Presages later work on identity, continuity, persistence
- Causal rigor theme throughout archive
