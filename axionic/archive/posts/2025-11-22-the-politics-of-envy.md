## Summary
This post critiques the modern political tendency to conflate relative inequality with actual harm, arguing that envy-driven distributionist politics is fundamentally misguided. Axios argues that absolute poverty has collapsed globally, yet political discourse remains fixated on comparative wealth metrics rather than capability expansion. The piece contends that envy is a primate-era heuristic being mistakenly elevated into moral principle, leading to destructive redistribution policies. It reaffirms the Axio framework's position that harm should be defined by reduction of agency through coercion, not by relative position disparities.

## Key Concepts
- **Envy as moral confusion** – The conflation of status anxiety with legitimate harm, treating comparative differences as injuries requiring political intervention.
- **Capability expansion vs. redistribution** – The argument that the proper moral metric is expanding individual agency and future possibilities, not equalizing relative positions.
- **Agency-based harm** – Reaffirmation that only absolute deprivation, coercive extraction, or systemic barriers constitute real harm; relative inequality is morally irrelevant unless it creates such constraints.
- **Destructor logic** – The pattern of tearing down capability to equalize resentment rather than expanding opportunity.

## Evolution Notes
- Extends the agency-protection principle from earlier posts into explicit political economics territory, directly engaging with contemporary redistribution debates.
- Marks a sharpening of Axio's political stance: moving from abstract agency theory to concrete rejection of envy-based policy frameworks.
- References the Hanson-Caplan debate as exemplifying the confusion between growth and distribution as moral priorities.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- How can societies balance the psychological reality of status anxiety with the ethical principle that relative position is morally irrelevant?
- At what threshold does wealth inequality create systemic barriers to agency that would qualify as legitimate harm under the Axio framework?
- Can capability expansion frameworks be politically viable when they explicitly reject envy-soothing as a policy goal?
