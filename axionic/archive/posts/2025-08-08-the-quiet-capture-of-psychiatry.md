## Summary
Examines ideological capture of psychiatry, particularly around gender dysphoria treatment. Medicine subordinated to political ideology; dissenting clinicians silenced; evidence-based practice replaced by ideological mandates. Core insight: When medicine takes orders from ideology, patient welfare becomes secondary to political objectives.
