# The Quiet Capture of Psychiatry

**Date:** August 8, 2025  
**Batch:** Batch 24 (Posts 1–25)

## Summary
Examines ideological capture of psychiatry, particularly around gender dysphoria treatment. Medicine subordinated to political ideology; dissenting clinicians silenced; evidence-based practice replaced by ideological mandates. Core insight: When medicine takes orders from ideology, patient welfare becomes secondary to political objectives.
