# [The Physics of Agency, Part 4: The Law of Control Work](https://axionic.org/posts/162543579.the-physics-of-agency-part-4-the.html)

**Date:** April 30, 2025  

## Summary

Establishes the Law of Control Work: exercising intentional control costs energy proportional to kybits (E_min = C × k × T × ln(2)). Agency is never free—each deliberate action consumes physical resources. Drift is spontaneous entropic evolution; control requires energy investment to move against entropy and amplify specific futures.
