## Summary

Critiques liberal democracies for institutionalizing permanent adolescence by balancing individualism, maternalism, and paternalism in ways that prevent full maturity.

**Key Concepts:**

**The Political Triangle:**
- **Individualism:** Personal freedom, productivity, innovation
- **Maternalism:** Safety nets, social programs, protection from hardship
- **Paternalism:** Regulation, law enforcement, stability, order

**The Central Equilibrium:**
Liberal democracies position themselves near center, balancing all three forces. Appears pragmatic but may be philosophically troubling.

**The Permanent Adolescence Critique:**
- Sheltered enough to become dependent
- Supported enough to discourage self-reliance
- Protected enough to limit personal accountability
- Regulated enough to curtail genuine autonomy and risk-taking

**Result:** Citizens suspended between autonomy, dependency, and control—never exercising complete responsibility or genuine self-determination. Remain passive beneficiaries rather than active, accountable agents.

**Question Posed:** Could society move toward model encouraging greater self-reliance, resilience, mature citizenship? Or does stability require permanent partial dependency?
