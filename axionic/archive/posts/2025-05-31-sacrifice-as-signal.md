# Sacrifice as Signal

**Date:** 2025-05-31  

## Summary

**To know what someone values, watch what they sacrifice.** Value = pattern of behavior, not feeling or opinion. **Core principle**: Something is valuable only if backed by action that costs. Cost/loss/trade-off = signal. Without sacrifice, no signal, no value. **Applications**: (1) Cuts through performative moralizing ("I care about X" without paying for X → don't care). (2) Revealed preference > stated preference (poll meaningless, observe trade-offs). (3) Applies to self-assessment (examine your own sacrifices to discover real values). **Dark side**: False signals (social pressure → sacrifices misaligned with actual values). But even hypocrisy reveals value hierarchy (status/conformity valued > honesty). **Duality**: Value = subjective (agent-relative), but sacrifice = objective (observable). **Intersection = truth**. Stop taking claims at face value—ask: What did they pay? What did they lose? Don't lie to yourself about your values.
