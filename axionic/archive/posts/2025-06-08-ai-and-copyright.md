## Summary

Argues AI training on copyrighted works is learning, not copying, and falls under fair use. Defends LLMs against copyright infringement claims.

**Key Concepts:**

**The Confusion:**
Conflating two fundamentally different acts: copying vs learning

**Copyright's Purpose:**
- Prevents unauthorized copying, reproduction, distribution
- Incentivizes creation by protecting against exact/near-exact copies
- Does NOT prohibit learning from protected materials

**Learning Is Protected:**
Examples of legal learning:
- Student internalizing textbook concepts
- Critic analyzing film
- Engineer studying patented inventions
All generate new, transformative work from protected materials

**AI Training as Learning:**
- LLMs statistically encode relationships and patterns
- Extract generalized understandings, linguistic structures
- Don't store or reproduce verbatim—they "learn," not "copy"
- Feeding text to model ≈ student reading book, not photocopying

**Legal Precedent:**
- Authors Guild v. Google affirms transformative uses (indexing, summarization, analysis) as fair use
- AI training is highly transformative

**The Misconception:**
People treat AI systems as storage devices rather than learners, but models are fundamentally abstract/transformative

**Central Argument:** Copyright protects against duplication, not learning or transformative innovation. AI embodies this distinction.

**Note:** Post includes disclaimer that it was composed with LLM assistance—meta-commentary on the argument itself.
