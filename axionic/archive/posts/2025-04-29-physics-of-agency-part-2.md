# [The Physics of Agency, Part 2: Agency vs Drift – The Thermodynamic Basis of Agency](https://axionic.org/posts/162485540.the-physics-of-agency-part-2-agency.html)

**Date:** April 29, 2025

## Summary
This installment formalizes the adversary of agency: entropic drift. Drift is the passive statistical tendency of systems toward disorder, while agency is the costly, model-driven resistance to that trend. By highlighting intentionality as an energetic act that sculpts futures away from maximum entropy, the post sets up a dialectic between passive unfolding and deliberate control.

## Key Concepts
- **Entropic drift** – Default evolution of systems without intervention, providing the baseline that agency must counteract.
- **Intentional resistance** – Agency requires predictive modeling plus energy expenditure to bias outcomes toward preferred states.
- **Local vs global dynamics** – Individual acts of control are framed as local struggles against the universe’s global entropic increase.

## Evolution Notes
- Bridges the conceptual definition of agency from Part 1 to the quantitative laws that follow by specifying the opponent (drift) in the physical narrative.
- Emphasizes responsibility: if drift dominates unless energy is spent, then doing nothing is itself a choice toward disorder.

## Open Questions
- Can we observe “drift signatures” in socio-technical systems to know when agency expenditure is urgently needed?
- How do agents triage where limited energy should be deployed when entropy pressures multiple fronts simultaneously?
