### Key Patterns Discovered

**Core Framework Established:**
- **Physics of Agency:** Kybits (units of control), 3 Thermodynamic Laws (control costs energy, agency decays, perfect control impossible), measure amplification in multiverse
- **Quantum Branching Universe (QBU):** DAG of all timelines, Strong/Weak Pattern Identifiers, rigorous causality definition
- **Conditionalism:** All truth conditional, rejection of absolute/unconditional claims, agent-relative perspectives
- **Agency Spectrum:** From MVA (minimal viable agent) to MTA (maximal theoretical agent/AIXI demon)

**Methodological Pillars:**
- Dialectic Agent: AI collaboration for idea refinement (reveals co-creation process)
- Steelman approach: Charitable interpretation before critique
- Cross-domain integration: Physics → ethics, quantum → politics

**Emerging Themes:**
- Agency as physical phenomenon (not psychological illusion)
- Measure matters (even in multiverse where all outcomes occur)
- Thermodynamic constraints fundamental (no free lunch for agency)
- Causality through branching structure (ancestor/descendant relations)
- Bridging physics to ethics (measure amplification → moral significance)

**Early Positioning:**
- Individualism grounded in agency physics
- AI alignment concerns present from start
- Libertarian/anarchist political implications
- Quantum realism (Everett/Many-Worlds commitment)

### Key Patterns Discovered

**Major Sequence: Defending Bayes (Parts 1-5)**
- Establishes Bayesian epistemology within QBU framework
- Distinguishes explanatory knowledge (theories) from empirical knowledge (timeline uncertainty)
- Reframes credence as timeline/indexical uncertainty (primary) + logical/semantic/metaphysical (secondary)
- Responds systematically to Deutsch/Hall critique
- Completes comprehensive credence theory

**QBU Formalization:**
- Rigorous definitions: Measure, Vantage, Branchcone, Counterfactuals
- Integration with Wallace's Emergent Multiverse
- Friston's Active Inference mapped to thermodynamic agency laws
- Starlight analogy defends MWI against Occam objection

**Creativity & Evolution:**
- Creativity = evolution (variation + selection), responds to open-endedness critique
- Virtual evolution with nested selection layers (unconscious → conscious)
- Quantum determinism + neural constraints = idea generation
- Intelligence defined via game theory framework

**Epistemology & Philosophy:**
- Sacred Coherence: logical coherence as supreme value
- Nonsense: technical definition, applied to theology/queer theory/astrology/homeopathy
- The Pattern: antisemitism as Schelling point (coordination theory)
- Ideas move atoms: semantic-physical causation alignment

**AI & Hybrid Cognition:**
- Dialectic Catalyst (refined from Agent): memory enables "Persistent Catalyst"
- Universal Alignment: Value-9s metric, P(doom) ~25%, OT skepticism
- Programming metaphor (not prompting) for AI interaction

**Political Philosophy Emerging:**
- LARPitarianism: voluntary role-play, anti-coercion
- Taxation-slavery spectrum: degree not kind difference
- Individualism grounded in agency physics
- Libertarian/voluntarist themes strengthening
