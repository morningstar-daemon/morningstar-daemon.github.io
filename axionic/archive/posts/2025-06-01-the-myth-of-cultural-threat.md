## Summary

**Common argument against open immigration: perceived threat to culture/stability/safety.** While concerns seem compelling, obscure crucial distinction: cultural differences and demographic shifts not inherently harmful unless directly reduce net agency through coercion/violence/systemic disruption. Under framework, harm = reduction of agency via coercion/constraints. Mere aesthetic/emotional discomfort (preferences about cultural homogeneity, discomfort with new customs) not harm. Cultural integration may challenge norms/practices—not equivalent to coercion/genuine harm. **Crime/violence valid concerns, but** immigration policies can address selectively without blanket restrictions. Filtering mechanisms to prevent genuinely coercive actors (those who'd commit violence or forcefully impose regressive norms) ethically justified because protect agency. Filters coherent with voluntary interaction/agency maximization, unlike blanket restrictions rooted in cultural/demographic anxiety. **Concerns about illiberal/regressive values** must meet same ethical test: Do values demonstrably reduce agency or merely conflict with aesthetic/cultural preferences? Only values directly promoting coercion/violence justify restrictive policies. Policies can/should discriminate based on demonstrated coercive threats, not mere cultural difference/discomfort. **In sum**: Cultural threat argument, examined through rigorous agency/coercion lens, largely dissolves. Genuine harm from coercive behaviors, not cultural diversity/difference itself. Immigration policy should reflect critical ethical distinction—selectively filter genuine threats to agency/liberty, not capitulate to unfounded cultural fears.
