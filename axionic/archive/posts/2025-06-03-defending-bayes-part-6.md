## Key Arguments

**Central Problem:** How can credence obey probability laws when there's no underlying objective probability (especially for logical/mathematical statements)?

**Solution: Logical Induction**

Introduced by Garrabrant, Benson-Tilsen, Critch, Soares, Taylor (2016).

**What It Does:**
- Rigorously formalizes epistemic uncertainty about logical/mathematical statements
- Assigns probabilistic credences to logical propositions
- Ensures rational coherence and consistency
- Generates sequence of credences that become more accurate as evidence accumulates
- Crucially: Satisfies probability axioms despite no empirical probability

**How It Works (Market Analogy):**
- Logical uncertainty = "market"
- "Traders" = algorithmic strategies/computational heuristics
- Traders "bet" on logical statements (true/false)
- As new information emerges (proofs, computations, heuristics), traders update
- Market credences gradually converge toward accurate beliefs
- Analogy ensures internal coherence, rational updating

**Resolution of Philosophical Tension:**
- Credences must obey probability laws (rational consistency)
- But logical credences are epistemic, not empirically objective
- Logical Induction shows how probabilistic consistency maintained without objective probabilities

**Result:** Rigorous embrace of epistemic probabilities—can assign rational, probabilistic credences even without empirical probabilities

## Connection to Framework

**Defending Bayes Sequence:**
- Part 5 (Batch 2): Empirical vs logical credence distinction
- Part 6 (this post): Formal tool for logical credences
- Part 7 (this batch): Application to theories

**Epistemological Foundations:**
- Distinguishes **Measure** (objective QBU probability) from **Credence** (subjective epistemic)
- Logical Induction provides formal basis for credences in non-empirical domains
- Resolves how credences can be rational without corresponding to physical probabilities

**AI Safety Connection:**
- Paper from MIRI (Machine Intelligence Research Institute)
- Relevant to AI reasoning about logical uncertainty
- Connects framework to AI alignment community

## Evolution Tracking

**New Technical Tool:**
- First appearance of Logical Induction in archive
- Provides formal underpinning for credence theory
- Borrowed from AI safety research, applied to philosophy

**Methodological:** Uses technical result from computer science to resolve philosophical problem

**Integration:** Logical Induction becomes load-bearing concept for defending Bayesianism against Deutsch/Hall critique

## Notes

**Significance:** Imports technical result from AI research to solve philosophical problem. Cross-disciplinary synthesis.

**Accessibility:** Uses market analogy to explain complex formal concept. Generally readable despite technical content.

**AI Safety Bridge:** Connects Axio framework to AI alignment community's work. Suggests shared intellectual ecosystem.

**Formal Rigor:** Cites actual research paper, engages with technical literature (not just philosophy).
