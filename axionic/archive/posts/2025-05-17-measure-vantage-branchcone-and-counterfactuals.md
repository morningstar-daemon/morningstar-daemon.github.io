## Summary

Formal definitions of four key QBU concepts. **Measure:** Objective probability (quantum amplitude squared) of events across branches. **Vantage:** Reference event-point ("now") anchoring timeline calculations—contains initial conditions. **Branchcone:** Set of all timelines branching from a Vantage through specific duration. **Counterfactuals:** Alternate Vantages with different past; counterfactual true iff Measure at alternate Vantage ~1 for consequent. Provides rigorous mathematical framework for QBU reasoning, removing ambiguity from probability, causality, and "what if" questions. Example: "If aspirin, no headache" = comparing Measure at two Vantages. Foundation for subsequent decision theory work.
