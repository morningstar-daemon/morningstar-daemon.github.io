# [A Rigorous Definition of Causality](https://axionic.org/posts/163348907.a-rigorous-definition-of-causality.html)

**Date:** 2025-05-11  

## Summary

*[Note: Content not fetched—inferring from title/context]*

Formal definition of causality within QBU framework. Likely uses ancestor/descendant relationships in branching DAG: event A causes B if all branches containing B contain A in their past light cone. Distinguishes causal necessity (Strong PIs guarantee common ancestor) from correlation (Weak PIs may lack causal connection). May address Pearl's causality framework compatibility, counterfactual definiteness, intervention vs observation. Technical foundation for causal reasoning throughout archive. Enables rigorous talk about agency shaping futures without magic/dualism.
