## Summary

Defines counterfactual implication rigorously within the Quantum Branching Universe (QBU) framework. Traditional counterfactual logic examines "nearest possible worlds" where event A occurs to verify event B also occurs. In QBU, branching timelines provide natural structure for this: given two events A and B, find their nearest common ancestor event E₀, then verify that every descendant timeline containing A also contains B. This preserves causation's asymmetric nature, integrates quantum branching structure, and provides a well-defined foundation for causal analysis in decision theory and ontology.

Formal definition of causality within QBU framework. Likely uses ancestor/descendant relationships in branching DAG: event A causes B if all branches containing B contain A in their past light cone. Distinguishes causal necessity (Strong PIs guarantee common ancestor) from correlation (Weak PIs may lack causal connection). May address Pearl's causality framework compatibility, counterfactual definiteness, intervention vs observation. Technical foundation for causal reasoning throughout archive. Enables rigorous talk about agency shaping futures without magic/dualism.
