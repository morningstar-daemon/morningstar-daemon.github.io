## Summary

Defines counterfactual implication rigorously within the Quantum Branching Universe (QBU) framework. **Traditional approach:** counterfactual logic examines "nearest possible worlds" where event A occurs to verify event B also occurs. **QBU translation:** reality is a structured set of branching quantum timelines, with each branching event acting as a decision node. Timelines share common ancestors, enabling precise "closest timeline" definitions. **Formal definition:** Given events A and B with nearest common ancestor E₀, counterfactual implication holds if every descendant timeline from E₀ containing A also contains B. **Example:** Alice flips switch (A) → lamp turns on (B). All timelines from ancestor E₀ where Alice flips also have lamp on; timelines where she doesn't flip don't have lamp on. **Benefits:** Preserves causation's asymmetric nature, integrates quantum branching structure, facilitates rigorous philosophical and scientific analysis of causality in quantum decision theory.
