## Summary
This post examines how to evaluate moral goodness using Effective Altruism (EA) as case study, emphasizing conditionalist approach to moral judgment. Six philosophical insights offered: **(1) Clarify basis of judgment**—Distinguish internal judgment (by your own moral standards) from external judgment (by standards target has chosen/professed). Conflating these causes ethical confusion. Example: Journalist Kelsey Piper donates 40-50% income to effective interventions—externally (by her standards) exemplary, internally depends on your values. **(2) Goodness is contextual, not absolute**—No universal moral standard exists. EA embodies virtues (rationality, generosity, consistency, measurable impact) widely respected but not universally prioritized. Admiring virtues ≠ asserting universal superiority. **(3) Integrity and authenticity are key virtues**—Consciously choosing ethical framework and living consistently within it, transparently aligning values and actions, deserves admiration across virtually any system valuing coherence and self-awareness. **(4) Transparency vs. privacy: philosophical choice**—EA prefers public giving (transparency encourages collective impact, leverages social norms); privacy around charity can reflect humility, authenticity, avoiding performative signaling. Neither inherently superior—each reflects underlying priorities. **(5) Common ground across frameworks**—Acknowledging EA's commendable traits (clarity, rationality, impact) fosters mutual respect, promotes understanding and cooperative alignment around shared virtues even if ultimate goals differ. **(6) Beware implicit objective moralizing**—Asserting moral superiority ("they're better people") implicitly assumes objective morality, philosophically problematic. Conditionalism demands rigorous clarity: always state conditions underlying moral judgments, avoid implying universal truths where none exist. Positions authenticity, integrity as virtues universally worth considering.

## Key Concepts
- **Internal vs. external judgment** – Judging by your standards vs. judging by target's chosen standards.
- **Conditionalist ethics** – Morality as conditional on explicitly stated values, not universal absolutes.
- **Contextual goodness** – Moral evaluation depends on values, goals, contexts—not absolute hierarchy.
- **Integrity as virtue** – Coherence between stated values and actions, transparent self-awareness.
- **Authenticity** – Living consistently within consciously chosen ethical framework.
- **Transparency vs. privacy tradeoff** – Public giving (collective impact) vs. private charity (authenticity, humility).
- **Cross-framework respect** – Acknowledging virtues across different value systems.
- **Anti-objective moralizing** – Rejecting implicit assumptions of universal moral truths.

## Evolution Notes
- Core application of Conditionalism to practical moral evaluation.
- Shows respect for EA movement while maintaining philosophical independence.
- Reflects anti-objectivism in ethics—consistent theme throughout Axio's work.
- Demonstrates method: using specific case (EA, Kelsey Piper) to illustrate general principles.
- Positions integrity and authenticity as meta-virtues transcending specific ethical frameworks.
- Part of pattern: philosophical rigor applied to everyday moral judgments.
- May reflect Axio's social context—likely engaged with EA community intellectually.
- Shows concern with avoiding moral absolutism while still making coherent judgments.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can conditionalist framework ground moral critique at all, or does it collapse into pure relativism?
- How distinguish authentic value adoption from rationalized self-interest?
- Does prioritizing integrity/authenticity as meta-virtues smuggle in objective morality?
- What prevents conditionalism from justifying abhorrent value systems (if internally consistent)?
- Can external judgment (by target's standards) meaningfully criticize when standards themselves are problematic?
- How handle cases where stated values and revealed preferences diverge—which is authentic?
- Does transparency always increase collective impact, or can it create perverse incentives (virtue signaling)?
- What grounds respect for other value systems—isn't some universal ethical commitment necessary?
- Can conditionalism distinguish genuine ethical diversity from moral error?
