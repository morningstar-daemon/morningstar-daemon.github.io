## Summary

Poverty is not natural state or result of exploitation but consequence of insufficient wealth creation. Historical norm was universal poverty; prosperity is the anomaly requiring explanation. Wealth generated by innovation, capital accumulation, institutional quality—not redistribution. Critiques zero-sum thinking: "poor exist because rich exist" reverses causality. Actual cause: insufficient productive capacity. Solution: expand pie, not fight over slices. Anti-inequality focus distracts from absolute welfare improvements.

## Key Concepts

- **Poverty as default** – Historical universal condition; prosperity requires explanation
- **Wealth creation vs redistribution** – Innovation/capital generate wealth; redistribution only moves it
- **Zero-sum fallacy** – Poverty caused by lack of production, not by inequality
