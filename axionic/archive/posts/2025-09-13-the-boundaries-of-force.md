## Summary

This post maps the conceptual boundaries where coercion transitions from illegitimate domination to justified agency-protection. Within Axio's Agency framework, coercion is understood as the credible threat of harm to force compliance — a violation of agency by default. However, the post distinguishes several contexts where coercion becomes legitimate: when pre-consented (contracts), defensive (deterring aggression), or compensatory (restoring stolen agency through restitution).

The core analytical move is recognizing that coercion remains coercion even when justified — it doesn't become something else. The credible threat still narrows authentic choice space. The difference is whether that narrowing serves justice (restoring/protecting agency) or domination (annihilating it). This distinction is load-bearing for Axio's entire political philosophy: it allows defense of robust property rights and voluntary governance while rejecting both anarcho-pacifism and utilitarian override of consent.

**Three Legitimating Conditions:**

1. **Pre-consent:** Contractual penalties are coercive enforcement of terms you voluntarily accepted. The coercion was priced into the agreement.
2. **Defense:** "Attack me and I'll retaliate" is coercion, but justified as boundary-setting that prevents greater harm.
3. **Restitution:** "Repay what you stole" is coercion aimed at restoring balance, not imposing domination.

**What Cannot Be Justified:**
- Preemptive domination without consent or defensive rationale
- Exploitation via threats to extract non-consented value
- Appeals to "greater good" that override agency primacy — aggregate utility doesn't justify coercion without consent

The post positions this framework as essential infrastructure for: distinguishing protected speech from criminal threats, clarifying that rights enforcement requires justified coercion, designing voluntary governance systems that permit meaningful exit, and preserving the line between justice and tyranny.

## Key Concepts

- **Illegitimate coercion** – Threats without consent, extortion, or arbitrary power that instrumentalize another's agency by poisoning non-compliant options with fear.
- **Pre-consented coercion** – Contractual enforcement mechanisms voluntarily accepted as part of an exchange (e.g., mortgage penalties).
- **Defensive coercion** – Boundary-setting threats that deter or prevent greater violations of agency (e.g., "attack me and I'll respond with force").
- **Compensatory/restorative coercion** – Requirements to undo prior harm through restitution, balancing scales rather than dominating.
- **Agency primacy** – The principle that aggregate utility calculations cannot override consent; coercion justified only by greater-good appeals remains illegitimate.
- **Meaningful exit** – The criterion that distinguishes voluntary governance from tyranny; coercion is legitimate only when participation is voluntary and exit remains possible.

## Evolution Notes

- **Bridges earlier violence/coercion distinction:** Follows from "Speech Is Not Violence" (#148) and "Incitement Is Not Coercion" (#104), sharpening conceptual boundaries between threat, speech, and force.
- **Grounds later governance frameworks:** The pre-consent mechanism becomes foundation for Axiocracy sequence (#278+), where voluntary governance systems enforce rules through justified coercion.
- **Restitution principle expands:** Connects to Universal Compensatory Justice (#45) — earlier post sketched the framework, this one operationalizes it via legitimate coercion.
- **Agency protection architecture:** Shows how robust libertarian framework defends strong property rights without collapsing into either pacifism or utilitarian consequentialism.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions

- **Implicit consent boundary:** When does participation in a system constitute genuine consent to its coercive enforcement? Can residency alone establish consent, or must there be explicit opt-in?
- **Exit costs:** How high can exit costs be before "voluntary" governance becomes practically involuntary? Is mere theoretical exit sufficient?
- **Defensive coercion scope:** Can deterrence extend to preemptive strikes against imminent threats, or does "defensive" strictly mean reactive? Where is the line between justified defense and aggressive first-move?
- **Collective goods enforcement:** Can coercion ever be justified to prevent free-riding on public goods in voluntary communities, or must all goods be privatizable?
- **Intergenerational consent:** How does pre-consent framework handle children born into governance systems they didn't choose? When does their participation become voluntary?
