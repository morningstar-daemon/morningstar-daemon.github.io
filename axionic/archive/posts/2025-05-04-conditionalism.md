# [Conditionalism](https://axionic.org/posts/162831503.conditionalism.html)

**Date:** 2025-05-04  

## Summary

Philosophical theory: all truth claims inherently depend on implicit/explicit conditions. Only conditional statements ("If X, then Y") can meaningfully hold truth values.

**Core Arguments:**
1. **Interpretation Necessity:** All truth claims require interpretation, which is context-dependent (linguistic conventions, conceptual frameworks, axioms, observational parameters)
2. **Implicit Conditions:** Conditions often hidden in ordinary discourse. Even seemingly absolute truths (logical tautologies, mathematical statements, existential assertions) implicitly depend on background conditions.
3. **Rejection of Unconditional Truths:** Unconditional truths philosophically incoherent—evaluation necessarily presupposes interpretive conditions.

**Philosophical Alignment:**
- Related to Quinean holism but extends it: truth values apply only to conditional statements, not isolated statements
- Related to Wittgenstein's language games (meaning depends on contextual frameworks)

**Practical Implications:**
- **Epistemology/Science:** Clarifies role of assumptions in theory evaluation, reinforces conditional/revisable nature of scientific knowledge
- **Decision Theory/Bayesianism:** Enhances clarity in conditional reasoning, probability updates. Aligns with Bayesian frameworks emphasizing conditionals.
- **QBU Integration:** Naturally fits quantum mechanics (esp. Many-Worlds). Events/choices hold truth values only relative to specific quantum timelines/branches.

**Key Insight:** Meaningful truth evaluation always inherently conditional. Explicitly recognizing hidden conditions clarifies discourse, enhances logical consistency.

## Notes

- Central pillar of axionic philosophy
- Rejects both absolute truth and relativism (truth conditional, not arbitrary)
- Becomes foundation for agent-relative ethics later
- Recurring methodological commitment throughout archive
