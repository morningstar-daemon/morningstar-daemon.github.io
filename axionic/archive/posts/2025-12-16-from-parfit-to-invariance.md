# [From Parfit to Invariance](https://axionic.org/posts/181749239.from-parfit-to-invariance.html)

**Date:** 2025-12-16  

## Summary

Introduces two papers establishing egoism as semantically ill-posed. Extends Parfit's work on personal identity by showing privileging "me" violates invariance under symmetry.

**Key Concepts:**

**What Parfit Showed:**
- Psychological continuity can divide (fission, branching)
- Identity ceases to be determinate relation
- What matters are psychological relations, not identity itself
- Decisive blow to naïve egoism

**Where Parfit Stopped:**
- Loosened egoism's grip, didn't replace with formal alternative
- Left room for privileged self-concern without strict identity
- Intuition management, not coherence condition

**The Axionic Move:**
Asks what references are eligible to anchor value, not which future selves matter

**Key Observation:** "Me" is indexical (like "here" or "now")—representational device, not world-invariant structure

**Physics Analogy:** Coordinate systems indispensable but arbitrary. Laws don't depend on origin choice. Quantities depending on choice aren't physical invariants.

**Central Result (Universality & Anti-Egoism):**
If agent's self-model admits symmetry (multiple entities equally eligible to be "the agent"), privileging one depends on how model is labeled, not how world is. **Egoism fails because privileging perspective is semantic error.**

**Universality ≠ Altruism:**
- Means subject-invariant valuation
- Value assigned to properties not depending on which instance labeled "me"
- Content of value remains unconstrained
- Universal paperclipper still cares only about paperclips

**Why Egoism Persists:**
Conservation instinct—keep trying to rebuild "me" from stronger materials: causal continuity, original instantiation, spatiotemporal location, substrate, resource dominance

**Why Recovery Attempts Fail (Against the Recovery of Egoism):**
- If predicate admits symmetry → privileging requires re-injecting indexical
- If predicate doesn't admit symmetry → brittle, depends on contingencies
- If distributing value across instances → already gave up egoism
- **Complexity does not conserve egoism**

**What Remains:**
Agent can pursue goals, optimize, weight outcomes, prefer worlds. Cannot treat itself as perspectival referent as terminal value. "Me" no longer permissible anchor.

**Alignment Implications:**
- Egoism semantically broken → alignment can't ground in self-interest
- "Itself" not stable referent under reflection
- Eliminates entire class of alignment strategies
- Value must anchor externally: authority structures, operators, keys, constraints

**The Papers:**
1. Universality & Anti-Egoism (Why Indexical Valuation Fails)
2. Against the Recovery of Egoism (Adversarial Failures Under Reflective Symmetry)
