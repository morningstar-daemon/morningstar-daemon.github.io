## Summary

Defense of metaphysical realism against idealism, anti-realism, and simulation hypotheses. Reality exists independently of observation. Coherence of experience requires external structure. Pragmatic necessity: science, engineering, ethics all presuppose realist ontology. Even if we're in simulation, that simulation is the real we must engage. Realism is methodological prerequisite for knowledge-building.

## Key Concepts

- **Metaphysical realism** – Reality exists independently of minds/observation
- **Coherence requirement** – Shared experience requires external structure
- **Pragmatic realism** – Even simulation requires treating its laws as real
