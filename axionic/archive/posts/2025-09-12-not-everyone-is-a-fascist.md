## Summary
This post critiques semantic inflation of "fascism" while defending Andrew Doyle's sharp redefinition. Historically, fascism referred to specific ideology: ultranationalism, corporatist statism, militarism, violent authoritarian control. Over decades, the word dulled into generic insult for "people I dislike on the right," robbing it of diagnostic utility. When everyone is fascist, the label becomes meaningless. Doyle's intervention offers Razor: "If you condone the murder of your political opponents, you're a fascist." This isn't exhaustive definition but sharp one, drawing bright line at political murder and reclaiming the word for contexts where it matters. His remark followed Charlie Kirk's assassination, when a fringe subset openly celebrated killing online. The majority condemned the assassination across the political spectrum, but celebratory post screenshots circulated widely, creating impression that "large fraction" of left was cheering—this is exaggeration. What exists is noisy fringe who crossed the line into condoning political murder. These aren't mainstream left but extremist edge. Doyle's definition applies with full force: by cheering political bloodshed, they disqualify themselves from moral high ground and embrace the authoritarian impulse they claim to resist. Fascism discourse suffers from two opposite distortions: overuse (calling every ordinary conservative fascist drains meaning) and under-focus (ignoring fringe that actually condones violence leaves genuine fascism unnamed). Doyle's "murder test" slices through both, preserving the word's moral weight while targeting precisely where it belongs. Fascism is not "neighbor who votes wrong" or "anyone with unpopular opinion"—it's crossing the line into legitimizing political murder. The fringe who cheered Kirk's death unmasked themselves. Language and precision matter. The line Doyle drew—murder as fascism threshold—is worth defending.

## Key Concepts
- **Semantic Inflation** – Word "fascism" dulled from specific ideology to generic insult, losing diagnostic utility.
- **Doyle's Razor** – Sharp redefinition: condoning political opponent murder qualifies as fascism.
- **Bright Line** – Political murder as clear threshold reclaiming the term for meaningful use.
- **Fringe vs. Mainstream** – Celebratory responses were noisy fringe, not large fraction of left.
- **Two Distortions** – Overuse (calling all conservatives fascist) and under-focus (ignoring violent fringe).
- **Murder Test** – Slices through both distortions, preserving moral weight while targeting precisely.
- **Self-Disqualification** – Cheering political violence disqualifies from moral high ground.
- **Precision Matters** – Language precision is necessary for meaningful political discourse.
- **Authoritarian Impulse** – Those condoning political murder embrace what they claim to resist.

## Evolution Notes
- Part of series defending precise language use in political discourse.
- Similar pattern to "The Islamophobia Trap"—critiquing motte-and-bailey term expansion.
- Shows Axio's commitment to linguistic precision across political spectrum.
- Relevant to understanding Axio's meta-political stance: defending clarity over tribal signaling.
- Connects to free speech themes: can't meaningfully defend speech if terms are inflated.
- Important for AI alignment: systems must handle politically charged terms with precision.
- Demonstrates willingness to criticize both term inflation and genuine extremism.
- Part of broader project maintaining meaningful moral/political vocabulary.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Is Doyle's murder test sufficient for fascism, or does it miss important elements (nationalism, corporatism)?
- Can we develop similar sharp tests for other politically inflated terms (socialism, communism, authoritarianism)?
- How do we distinguish celebrating individual political murder from supporting systemic violence (war, policing)?
- What mechanisms can restore precision to politically charged vocabulary after inflation occurs?
- Should AI systems actively resist semantic inflation by enforcing historical definitions?
- Is there a way to quantify semantic drift to track when terms lose diagnostic utility?
- Does this analysis apply symmetrically to right-wing term inflation (communist, socialist)?
- How do we prevent necessary moral condemnation from inflating into meaningless labels?
