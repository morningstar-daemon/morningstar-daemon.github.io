## Summary
This post identifies a subtle cognitive failure mode where sophisticated minds over-upgrade ambiguous evidence that activates their specialized tools, using Robin Hanson's UFO analysis as a case study. When data is low-bandwidth or noisy, intelligence naturally bends toward hypotheses that maximize the relevance of its own machinery—economists see incentives, physicists see invariants. Hanson's shift toward alien or conspiracy explanations for UFO phenomena exemplifies this: the hypotheses he selects are precisely those that restore his comparative advantage in modeling agency, coordination, and strategic behavior. The corrective discipline is to penalize evidence that flatters your preferred analytical toolkit.

## Key Concepts
- **Tool bias** – Intelligence selecting hypotheses that maximize relevance of its own specialized machinery, even when data is too thin to justify them.
- **Likelihood misspecification** – Treating correlated sensor channels as independent evidence, artificially inflating confidence.
- **Silence as entropy** – Bureaucratic opacity from risk aversion and drift, not sustained coordination.
- **Epistemic penalty** – When ambiguous evidence energizes preferred tools, impose additional skepticism to prevent self-portraiture masquerading as inference.
- **Specialist failure mode** – Applying sharp agent-centric toolkit to domains dominated by noise and institutional dysfunction.

## Evolution Notes
- Identifies failure mode that affects sophisticated reasoners more than naive ones—expertise creates vulnerability.
- Shows how Bayesian form can mask substantive errors when priors and likelihoods are warped by cognitive attractors.
- Provides discipline for preventing intellectual tools from determining perceived world structure.

## Open Questions
- How can specialists develop systematic defenses against tool bias without abandoning their expertise?
- Are there domains where tool bias is adaptive rather than problematic?
- What institutional structures would help detect and correct for tool bias in policy analysis?
