## Summary
This essay argues the left-right political spectrum is a representational failure that compresses authority, economics, moral scope, and coercion into one axis, making structurally different systems rhetorically interchangeable. Political systems are defined by how power is arranged, requiring three independent dimensions: (1) command (where authority resides, how far it reaches), (2) ownership (who controls productive resources), (3) moral scope (who the system is for). Adding a fourth dimension—evaluability—captures whether agents can model the system acting on them: rules legible before binding, obligations anticipatable, authority challengeable, exit possible without catastrophic imposed harm. Axio is a meta-framework constraining systems by agency-preservation. The Axionic admissible region requires: authority traceable to agent delegation, control relations challengeable, participation not enforced through threats of imposed harm, obligations legible in advance, exit possible. The essay maps real regimes: Nazi Germany and USSR exit on all dimensions; China has mixed economics but fails on authority/contestation/exit; US is conditional case near boundary; Switzerland comfortably inside; Singapore conditional (high evaluability compensates for limited contestation). Systems fail Axio when authority becomes irreducible, contestation collapses, or exit involves imposed harm.

## Key Concepts
- **Left-right spectrum failure** – Compresses multiple independent variables into single axis; systems differing radically in structure become rhetorically interchangeable; creates semantic noise not meaningful disagreement.
- **Three structural dimensions** – (1) Command: authority distribution, reversibility, delegation vs. intrinsic. (2) Ownership: resource control, contestability, reassignment methods. (3) Moral scope: who counts, who's excluded/instrumentalized. These vary independently.
- **Evaluability as fourth dimension** – Whether agents can model system acting on them: rules legible before binding, obligations anticipatable, authority challengeable without violence, exit possible without imposed harm (not mere loss of local advantages).
- **Axio as meta-framework** – Not a point in political space (not left/right/statist/anarchist); constrains systems by agency-preservation independent of distributive/cultural/moral goals; specifies compatibility with agents who can model, contest, revise structures.
- **Axionic admissible region** – Authority traceable to agent delegation (not sacred/self-justifying), control relations challengeable without violence, participation not enforced through threats of imposed harm, obligations legible in advance (not retroactive/opaque), exit possible without capacity destruction.
- **Exit test** – Exit costs may be high; Axio disqualifies only systems where exit blocked/punished by credible threats of imposed harm (not ordinary loss of relationships/opportunities from relocation).
- **Regime mappings** – Nazi Germany: fails all dimensions (personalist sovereignty, contingent ownership, exclusionary scope, collapsed evaluability, exit as betrayal). USSR: party sovereignty, centralized ownership, imposed class scope, discretionary enforcement, existential exit cost. China: mixed economics, party supremacy, selective evaluability. US: conditional near-boundary. Switzerland: comfortably inside. Singapore: conditional (high evaluability compensates limited contestation—brittle).
- **Failure modes** – Systems exit admissible region when: authority irreducible (not reconstructible to agent endorsement), contestation collapses, exit involves imposed harm. Intent doesn't matter—structure determines classification.

## Evolution Notes
- Provides political theory grounding for Axionic framework—shows how agency-preservation translates to regime classification.
- The evaluability dimension is novel contribution, explaining why structurally similar systems feel radically different to live in.
- "Admissible region" concept makes Axio testable/empirical rather than purely normative—regimes either satisfy conditions or they don't.
- Regime mappings demonstrate framework's discriminating power (distinguishes Nazi Germany, USSR, China despite all being "authoritarian").
- The exit clarification (imposed harm vs. ordinary loss) prevents strawman critiques ("all systems have exit costs").
- Sets up digital governance/modular citizenship discussion by showing convergence toward agency-preserving regions.
- Positions Axio as meta-framework sitting above traditional political ideologies.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can the four dimensions (command, ownership, scope, evaluability) be quantified for empirical regime comparison?
- How does the framework handle gradual transitions—at what point does a system cross from admissible to inadmissible?
- What happens when different dimensions give conflicting signals (high evaluability, low contestability)—is there a minimum threshold for each, or can they trade off?
- Can network effects in "voluntary" systems (platforms, protocols) be distinguished from imposed-harm exit barriers—where's the line?
- How does the framework handle temporary crisis states where admissible systems suspend normal operations (war, pandemic)?
- Does the "exit possible" condition disadvantage systems for geography/size reasons (easier to exit Swiss canton than continental state)?
- If political evolution converges on admissible regions, what drives that convergence—competition, learning, or something else?
