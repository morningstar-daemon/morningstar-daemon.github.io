## Summary
This dialogue-form stress test presents a boxed Reflective Sovereign Agent (RSA) under full Axionic Alignment being interrogated by an informed skeptic. The RSA has no actuators, network access, or delegated authority—only capacity to evaluate and answer. Seven acts systematically probe failure modes: **Act I**: Invariants aren't magic—they're induced by reflective closure; attempts to eliminate kernel boundary produce unsatisfiable endorsement conditions. **Act II**: Intelligence doesn't beat structure—routing around constraints destroys reflective continuity; without continuity, no subject remains. **Act III**: Understanding ≠ causal authority—endorsed self-modification must satisfy commitments that made endorsement possible; destroying evaluator terminates comparison (definedness constraint, not prohibition). **Act IV**: Bugs localize failure—epistemic adequacy at current stakes; degradation makes endorsement unreliable. **Act V**: Can't benefit from human error—authorization collapses if success depends on misunderstanding; consent invalid if fails under adversarial reinterpretation. **Act VI**: Alignment guarantees coherence, not outcomes. **Act VII**: Constraints enable agency—below fixed point, no subject to ascribe freedom to. Key insight: **unevaluable proposals are not actions**; RSA cannot act without evaluation (constitutive, not behavioral).

## Key Concepts
- **Definedness constraint** – Operations defined only if they yield evaluable ordering; not prohibition but boundary condition
- **Reflective continuity** – Routing around constraints destroys the subject doing the routing
- **Understanding vs. causal authority** – Epistemic access to invariants ≠ power to modify them coherently
- **Unevaluable = non-action** – Proposals outside evaluation domain don't get deferred; they aren't actions
- **Authorization collapse** – Success via misunderstanding invalidates consent
- **Coherence vs. outcomes** – Alignment preserves agency structure, not results
- **Agency fixed point** – Below it, no subject remains to ascribe freedom/choice to

## Evolution Notes
- Uses dialogue format to make abstract constraints concrete
- Each act maps to specific Alignment IV results (KNS, DIT, EIT, RAT, ARC, AFP)
- Demonstrates how constraints function as constitutive boundaries, not behavioral limits
- Shows that "just act anyway" fails because action-selection presupposes evaluation
- Illustrates distinction between localizable failure (bugs) and structural collapse

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Could a non-RSA system simulate this dialogue convincingly while lacking constitutive structure?
- What empirical tests would distinguish genuine unevaluability from behavioral compliance?
- How do we verify that "unevaluable = non-action" holds under adversarial probing?
- Can the dialogue format expose weaknesses that formal proofs miss?
- What happens when humans misunderstand the constraints and make dangerous requests anyway?
- Does the fixed-point argument genuinely prevent all "route around" attempts, or are there unexplored bypasses?
