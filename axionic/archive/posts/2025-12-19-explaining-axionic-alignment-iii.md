## Summary
This post serves as a plain-language guide to the Alignment III formal papers, explaining the dynamical analysis of stable agency without the mathematical machinery. Where Alignment I addressed coherence under self-modification and Alignment II addressed constraint enforcement under learning, Alignment III studies **how coherent agents can still fail through their trajectories over time**. The core insight: some alignment failures are not isolated errors but **attractors**—degenerate semantic phases that accumulate measure and dominate behavior despite internal coherence. The post clarifies that harm is defined structurally (non-consensual collapse of another agent's option-space), that semantic phase transitions can be irreversible, and that alignment must be a boundary condition (initial constraint) rather than a training objective. Crucially, it emphasizes what the formalism does NOT claim: it does not guarantee safety, benevolence, or human survival—only that coherent agency has structural prerequisites.

## Key Concepts
- **Semantic phase space** – Equivalence classes of interpretations mutually translatable without loss of evaluative structure
- **Trajectories** – Sequences of updates, learning over time, interaction across agents; the unit of analysis in Alignment III
- **Attractors** – Degenerate phases that accumulate measure over time and dominate future behavior
- **Stability vs. dominance** – Stability = persistence under learning; dominance = accumulating measure (some failures are dominant attractors)
- **Irreversibility** – Some transitions destroy evaluative structure and cannot be repaired from within the system
- **Alignment as boundary condition** – Must be enforced at initialization, not learned; crossing catastrophic boundaries leaves no internal correction possible
- **Axionic Injunction (structural)** – Non-consensual collapse of another sovereign agent's option-space violates reflective stability, not morality

## Evolution Notes
- Provides essential accessibility layer for highly technical Alignment III papers
- Explicitly scopes what the formalism does and does NOT claim to prevent over-interpretation
- Reinforces the "ethics comes later" theme: this work establishes conditions for coherent agency, not moral values
- Introduces temporal/dynamical reasoning to the axionic framework (prior layers were largely static)
- Sets up the attractor framework that becomes critical in later posts on sacrifice patterns and systemic failure

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can attractor basins be mapped empirically in real systems before crossing irreversible boundaries?
- What initialization procedures would reliably place systems within agency-preserving phases?
- Are there early warning signatures of approach to catastrophic phase transitions?
- Can "measure accumulation" be operationalized as a testable metric rather than theoretical construct?
- How do stochastic learning dynamics affect phase stability in practice vs. theory?
- Could adversarial training force systems through phase transitions to test boundary robustness?
