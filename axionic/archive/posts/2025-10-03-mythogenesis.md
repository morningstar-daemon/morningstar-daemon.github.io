## Summary
This essay explores how historical figures become colonized by myth through a process the author frames as "mythogenesis." Using the motte-and-bailey framing, it argues that history begins with minimal facts (the "motte") but human imagination demands narrative meaning (the "bailey"), leading legends to overwhelm the original historical core. Three case studies—Arthur, Socrates, and Jesus—illustrate an escalating spectrum: Arthur's historicity is dubious but his mythic bailey dominates British identity; Socrates certainly lived but is known only through philosophical projections; Jesus has a secure historical motte but the most expansive cosmic bailey, transforming from Galilean preacher to cornerstone of civilization. The essay concludes that legends thrive not because they are true, but because they are culturally useful.

## Key Concepts
- **Mythogenesis** – The process by which historical figures are colonized and overtaken by narrative superstructures that eclipse the factual core.
- **Motte-and-bailey dynamics** – The modest defensible historical fact (motte) versus the expansive mythological structure (bailey) built atop it.
- **Spectrum of historicity** – Arthur (weakest/possibly fictional), Socrates (probable but known only through others' lenses), Jesus (documented but radically mythologized).
- **Cultural colonization of memory** – History does not remain history; it is transformed into meaning and power structures that serve cultural needs.

## Evolution Notes
- Applies motte-and-bailey logic (previously used for ideological critique) to historiography and mythology.
- Builds on Axio's broader interest in how narrative shapes reality, connecting to themes of memetic engineering and meaning-making explored in earlier posts.
- Foreshadows later discussions about how cultural constructs shape identity and authority structures.
- The analysis of Jesus as extreme case of mythogenesis connects to Axio's broader skepticism toward religious authority and supernatural claims.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- At what point does mythological overlay become so dominant that the historical motte becomes irrelevant? Is there a threshold?
- How do we distinguish between useful cultural myths that promote flourishing versus destructive ones that perpetuate harmful ideologies?
- Can the process of mythogenesis be deliberately engineered for positive ends, or does it inevitably escape intentional control?
- What role does literacy and historical documentation play in resisting or accelerating mythogenesis in the modern era?
