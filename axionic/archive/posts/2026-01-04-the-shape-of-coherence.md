## Summary
This post refines Axio's understanding of coherence from logical consistency to identity preservation across transformation. Early Axio elevated coherence (logical consistency) as indispensable; Chaos Sequence forced deeper analysis: before beliefs can be consistent, patterns must persist long enough to be interpreted. In algorithmic information theory's Chaos—where almost all descriptions are incompressible noise—consistency is cheap (randomness doesn't contradict itself) but patterns fail to survive transformation. Axio now defines coherence pre-semantically: property of patterns admitting stable identity preservation across transformation via non-degenerate mappings. This applies to physical attractors, organisms, algorithms, institutions, agents—not just beliefs. Most of Chaos is pre-coherent, disappearing before qualifying for filtering. Logical consistency is coherence applied to inferential transformations specifically—identity preservation under reasoning. This clarifies why agents tolerate local inconsistency without collapse (belief revision, scientific progress preserve global identity) and why vacuous consistency preserves nothing. Epistemic coherence is specialization not foundation. Stack: Chaos supplies possibility → coherence selects identity-preserving patterns → constructors enact repeatable transformations → agency adds choice → epistemics adds interpretation → logic enforces coherence at inferential level.

## Key Concepts
- **Coherence as identity preservation** – Pattern admitting stable re-identification across transformation, not logical consistency alone
- **Pre-semantic coherence** – Applies before meaning/belief/interpretation; to physical, biological, algorithmic patterns
- **Non-degenerate mapping** – Preserves pattern viability under constraints; arbitrary loose mappings fail filtering
- **Inferential transformation** – Logical consistency is coherence applied to reasoning specifically
- **Local vs global inconsistency** – Systems tolerate tension while preserving trackable identity
- **Chaos filtering** – Patterns failing identity preservation disappear structurally
- **Axio stack** – Chaos → coherence → constructors → agency → epistemics → logic

## Evolution Notes
- Major refinement of foundational concept from philosophical/epistemic to ontological/pre-semantic
- Resolves tension between Chaos Sequence and earlier coherence emphasis
- Clarifies scope: logical consistency important but specialized application
- Connects to Conditionalism: interpretation requires coherent background assumptions
- Makes explicit: existence requires coherence, meaning requires consistency (same constraint, different depths)

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can we operationalize "non-degenerate mapping" rigorously for all pattern types?
- Are there patterns that preserve identity without qualifying as coherent under this definition?
- How does identity preservation relate to information-theoretic measures of structure?
- Can incoherent patterns ever "recover" coherence or is filtering irreversible?
- What's the relationship between coherence-as-identity and consciousness/phenomenal binding?
