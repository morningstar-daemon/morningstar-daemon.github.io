## Summary
This post identifies the terminal level of the nested game hierarchy introduced in "Games and Metagames": the ultimate metagame is the competition among patterns for persistence across time. Axios argues the ladder must end because an infinite regress of metagames would lack grounding for goals and incentives. The key insight: every game presupposes the player exists long enough to play it—making persistence the universal precondition. This applies not just to biological life but to ideas, technologies, institutions, behaviors, cultures, strategies, and cognitive patterns. Unlike lower games with explicit rules, the ultimate metagame operates through constraints (entropy, energy, physics of replication, coherence stability). All other games—economic, political, cultural, intellectual—are subgames optimizing for various forms of persistence (genetic, memetic, structural, functional, cognitive).

## Key Concepts
- **Ultimate metagame** – The universal selection process determining which patterns continue to exist, dissolve, or propagate into the future.
- **Persistence as precondition** – Not a goal among others but the structural requirement making any goals possible; if pattern dissolves, its values dissolve with it.
- **Ladder termination** – Why metagame hierarchy can't be infinite: requires grounding point where evaluation becomes self-sustaining.
- **Coherent persistence** – Not mere continuation but maintaining identity as a coherent pattern stable enough across time.
- **Constraint-based game** – Unlike explicit-rule games, the ultimate metagame operates through physical/structural constraints (entropy, energy, replication physics, information durability).
- **Subgame embedding** – Evolution (genetic), culture (memetic), institutions (structural), technology (functional), agents (cognitive/behavioral) as domain-specific persistence optimization.

## Evolution Notes
- Payoff post for the metagame sequence (posts 81, 84), revealing the terminal level of the hierarchy.
- Connects persistence to agency, values, and meaning: "meaning becomes possible because of [persistence], not erased by it."
- The non-nihilistic framing ("this does not tell you what to value; it tells you what all values depend on") anticipates objections.
- Sets up framework that later posts will use to analyze specific domains through persistence lens.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Does identifying persistence as the ultimate metagame actually resolve value questions, or just defer them to "what helps this pattern persist?"
- Can patterns genuinely optimize for their own persistence without consciousness/intentionality, or is this anthropomorphizing selection?
- What happens when pattern-level persistence conflicts with agent-level values? (e.g., genetic fitness vs. individual flourishing)
- Does the framework adequately distinguish between patterns worth preserving and parasitic patterns that merely happen to persist?
