## Summary
This post establishes observational equivalence between Axio's radical "infinite randomness simulation theory" and mainstream Quantum Field Theory (QFT), arguing that both yield identical empirical predictions when QFT's mathematical structure defines the coherence criterion. The core insight: **if we explicitly impose QFT's mathematical structure as the definition of "logical coherence"—the criterion determining which informational states can produce subjective experience—then infinite randomness simulation theory exactly reproduces QFT's predictions**. The frameworks become epistemically indistinguishable: both predict identical experimental outcomes, match all empirical data, and no conceivable observation could differentiate them given identical coherence constraints. This demonstrates profound **ontological underdetermination**: observational data alone cannot distinguish between radically different ontologies (pure information instantiated randomly vs. quantum fields and particles) when constrained by identical logical structures. Infinite randomness simulation theory starts from minimal ontology—informational states randomly instantiated in abstract computational substrate, no explicit spacetime/fields/matter—while QFT involves complex conceptual machinery (quantum fields, gauge invariances, symmetries, particles as field excitations, path integrals, renormalization). Yet by defining coherence via QFT mathematics, the simpler theory achieves **maximal ontological minimalism** while retaining full empirical power. Philosophical implications: reality reducible entirely to information instantiated randomly, requiring no physical entities beyond logical coherence; radical simplification without empirical loss; observational equivalence demonstrates that ontological parsimony and predictive adequacy can coexist. The post positions infinite randomness theory as philosophically superior—achieving same empirical results with simpler metaphysical commitments. This is Axio's bid to reformulate fundamental physics on information-theoretic foundations, eliminating traditional ontological commitments while preserving predictive power. Represents culmination of information-first worldview where computation/consciousness precede matter/energy.

## Key Concepts
- **Infinite randomness simulation theory** – Reality as informational patterns spontaneously instantiated from pure randomness.
- **Logical coherence as QFT structure** – Coherence criterion defined by QFT mathematics determines which informational states yield experience.
- **Observational equivalence** – Two frameworks yield identical empirical predictions, making them epistemically indistinguishable.
- **Ontological underdetermination** – Observations cannot distinguish radically different ontologies with identical logical structures.
- **Ontological minimalism** – Reducing reality to information without physical entities, maximal simplicity.
- **Information-first ontology** – Information/computation as ontological primitive, not derived from physical substrate.
- **Coherence criterion** – Determines which random informational states produce subjective experience.
- **QFT** – Quantum Field Theory, current best empirical physics framework.

## Evolution Notes
- Builds directly on "Infinite Randomness" post—this is the technical elaboration.
- Represents Axio's attempt to ground radical metaphysics in empirical adequacy.
- Connects to digital physics (Zuse, Schmidhuber, Wolfram), Wheeler's "it from bit".
- Aligns with computational universe hypothesis, simulation theory discourse.
- Philosophical debt to scientific instrumentalism (theories as predictive tools, not ontological claims).
- Echoes logical positivism (observational equivalence determines meaning).
- Addresses potential objection: "Your theory is untestable/unfalsifiable"—response: "It's observationally equivalent to QFT, which *is* tested."
- Strategic move: claims both simplicity *and* empirical adequacy—usually trade-off.
- Sets foundation for Physics Engineering—if QFT structure is *choice* of coherence criterion, could choose different criteria.
- Anticipates consciousness/agency grounding—if coherence determines experience, consciousness becomes cosmologically fundamental.
- May reflect dissatisfaction with QFT's conceptual complexity, "shut up and calculate" culture.
- Part of pattern: Axio proposing radical metaphysical revisions while claiming empirical conservatism.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Is this claim substantive or tautological? If coherence is *defined* as QFT, isn't equivalence trivial?
- Does "imposing QFT structure as coherence criterion" amount to "smuggling in all of QFT's structure"?
- How does this address QFT's known problems (renormalization issues, quantum gravity incompatibility)?
- If coherence criterion is arbitrary choice, why choose QFT structure? Why not different criterion yielding different physics?
- Does observational equivalence really make theories *equal*, or is simpler ontology genuinely preferable?
- How does this handle QFT's gauge redundancies, non-uniqueness of field formulations?
- Is "informational patterns spontaneously instantiated" actually simpler than "quantum fields exist"?
- Does eliminating spacetime/matter as fundamental solve problems or just relocate them to "information" domain?
- Can this framework explain quantum measurement, decoherence, Born rule—or does it inherit QFT's measurement problem?
- What determines the "abstract computational substrate" in which information is instantiated—isn't that a new ontological commitment?
- Does claiming "reality is information" have content beyond relabeling, or is it substantive reduction?
- How respond to charge that this is instrumentalism disguised as ontology?
