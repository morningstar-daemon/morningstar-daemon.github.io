# [Policy on Precedence and Contradictions](https://axionic.org/posts/164447944.policy-on-precedence-and-contradictions.html)

**Date:** 2025-05-26  

## Summary

Meta-level policy: **Later entries supersede earlier ones** when contradictions arise. Examples: "Dialectic Catalyst" refines "Dialectic Agent"; "Defending Bayes Part 5" expands Part 2's scope. **Rationale:** (1) **Conditionalism**—truths depend on conditions/assumptions, which evolve. (2) **QBU framework**—later posts = distinct intellectual Vantages with updated Measure (more complete understanding). (3) **Evolutionary Epistemology**—contradictions signal growth, self-criticism, refinement. **Practical implications:** Prioritize later posts; older remain valuable historical records; "Foundational/Canonical" require explicit supersession statement. Transparent policy reinforcing intellectual rigor, authenticity, iterative advancement. Embodies commitment to evolving knowledge over fixed doctrine.
