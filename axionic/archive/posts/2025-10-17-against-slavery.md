# Against Slavery

## Summary
This provocative essay argues modern taxation is slavery in bureaucratized form—identical coercive structure disguised by moral abstractions. Where ancient slaveowners claimed the right to human output via birth/caste/conquest, modern states claim it via law (taxation), replacing whips with audit letters and overseers with revenue agencies. The key difference is cosmetic: distributed violence hidden behind "social contract" and "common good" rhetoric, making victims believe they're participants in virtue ("I pay my fair share"). The essay rejects the defense that taxation funds beneficial services: "The use of stolen labor for socially approved ends does not negate the theft. It compounds it, by laundering coercion through moral rhetoric." Coercion doesn't become moral when democratized; consent under threat isn't genuine consent. The piece concludes that future generations will see our era not as having abolished slavery but as having perfected it—"replaced chains with compliance, whips with withholding, and submission with civic pride." Full abolition requires condemning taxation as slavery.

## Key Concepts
- **Taxation as slavery** – Nonconsensual claim on labor fruits enforced by credible threats, structurally identical to historical slavery.
- **Distributed coercion** – Modern state violence is indirect/bureaucratic rather than direct/physical but functionally equivalent.
- **Moral abstraction laundering** – "Social contract" and "common good" as euphemisms concealing coercive structure.
- **Consent under threat** – Democratic participation doesn't make coercion voluntary when refusal brings imprisonment.
- **Use doesn't justify theft** – Beneficial outcomes from coerced labor don't negate the coercion, they compound it morally.
- **Agency as sacred** – Freedom fundamentally means right to decide labor allocation without sanctioned punishment.

## Evolution Notes
- Represents the most radical expression of Axio's anarchist political philosophy—uncompromising rejection of state taxation.
- Extends minimum wage critique into comprehensive condemnation of coercive redistribution.
- The "perfected slavery" argument inverts progressive narratives of moral improvement.
- Positions taxation alongside historical atrocities, refusing gradualist compromise.
- The rhetorical strategy: force readers to apply stated opposition to slavery consistently.
- Likely controversial even within libertarian circles (many accept minimal state taxation).

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- How does a complex society provide genuinely public goods (defense, infrastructure, research) without coercive taxation?
- Is the slavery analogy rhetorically effective or does it trivialize historical atrocities?
- Does the framework distinguish between different taxation types (income vs. consumption vs. land value) or condemn all equally?
- What about implicit consent—does long-term residence in a jurisdiction constitute acceptance of its rules?
- How do we handle free-rider problems when public goods require universal contribution but consumption can't be excluded?
- If taxation is slavery, is military conscription also slavery, and if so, how do societies defend themselves voluntarily?
- What prevents wealthy individuals/corporations from dominating voluntary systems through sheer resource advantage?
