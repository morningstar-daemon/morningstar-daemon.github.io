## Summary

Proposes deliberately circular ontology as philosophically superior to foundationalist alternatives. Core insight: interpretation always relies upon existing interpretations—no context-free starting points exist. Rather than defect, circularity embodies fundamental truth about meaning-making.

**The Five-Part Circular Ontology:**

1. **Property:** Observable interpreted by agent
2. **Object:** Set of related properties
3. **System:** Set of related objects
4. **Process:** System that evolves over time
5. **Agent:** Process that interprets observables as properties

Circularity explicit: "agent" interprets "property," but "property" requires "agent" for interpretation. This mutual dependency intentional.

**Philosophical Justification:**

**Circularity as Feature:**
- Traditional ontology seeks linear hierarchies or stable groundings
- Foundationalism overlooks interpretive conditions axioms presuppose
- All interpretation demands context; contexts depend on interpretations
- Embracing circularity acknowledges mutual dependency

**Conditionalist Foundation:**
- Aligns with conditionalism: truth/meaning always hinge on implicit contextual conditions
- No unchallengeable starting points possible
- Interpretation inherently context-dependent
- Attempting foundationalism philosophically misguided

**Process-Based Agency:**

**Agent as Process:**
- Defines agency explicitly as type of process
- Agency dynamic, temporal, interpretative—not static or foundational
- Continually reconstituting meaning through active interpretation

**Alignment with Modern Frameworks:**
- Systems Theory: emergent properties from interactions
- Active Inference: agents as prediction machines
- Quantum Branching: observer-dependent reality
- Emphasizes agency as active participant in meaning-creation

**Scalability:**
- Framework scales across complexity levels
- Minimal computational systems to human cognition
- Potential artificial intelligences
- Single framework without separate treatment for different agent types

**Addressing Objections:**

**Observability Critique:**
- What counts as "observable"? Physical? Quantum? Computational? Perceptual?
- Response: Deliberately left undefined as openness to context-specific clarification
- Observability itself subject to agent interpretation
- Returns to conditionalism: meaning hinges on contextual conditions

**Agency Narrowness:**
- Is definition too narrow, over-emphasizing sophisticated interpretive capacity?
- Response: Feature not flaw
- Framing agency as interpretive processes allows scalability
- Minimal systems to sophisticated cognition without separate frameworks

**Circularity Problem:**
- Traditional objection: circular definitions invalid
- Response: Circularity unavoidable when dealing with interpretation
- Making it explicit and transparent more honest than hidden circularities
- Foundationalism fails by smuggling in unacknowledged interpretive contexts

**Philosophical Implications:**

**Anti-Foundationalism:**
- Rejects search for secure metaphysical foundations
- No "bottom turtle" upon which everything rests
- Reality interpretatively structured all the way down

**Interpretive Realism:**
- Not subjective idealism (reality independent of any single mind)
- But reality accessed only through interpretive frameworks
- Structure of reality and interpretive access mutually constitutive

**Coherence Over Correspondence:**
- Truth as coherence within interpretive frameworks
- Not correspondence to framework-independent reality
- Frameworks evaluated by internal consistency and practical utility

**Meta-Level Insight:**
- Ontology itself interpretive activity
- No view from nowhere
- Even minimal ontology makes interpretive commitments
- Acknowledging this explicitly enhances philosophical clarity

**Connections to Broader Project:**

**Foundation for Later Work:**
- Minimal ontology enables discussion of agency without metaphysical baggage
- Supports agent-relative ethics (no objective "view from nowhere")
- Enables axionic alignment (agents interpreting own constraints)

**Methodological Commitment:**
- Transparency about philosophical commitments
- Explicit acknowledgment of interpretive conditions
- Parsimony: minimal necessary categories

**Practical Utility:**
- Provides workable framework for discussing complex systems
- Avoids metaphysical debates about "ultimate reality"
- Focuses on relationships and processes rather than substances

## Key Concepts

- **Circular ontology** – Deliberately self-referential categorical structure
- **Interpretive dependency** – All meaning requires interpretive context
- **Agent as process** – Agency as dynamic temporal activity not substance
- **Observable** – Context-dependent, agent-interpreted feature
- **Property/object/system/process/agent** – Five mutually defining categories
- **Anti-foundationalism** – Rejection of secure metaphysical groundings
- **Scalable agency** – Framework applying across complexity levels
- **Conditionalist ontology** – Being itself interpretatively structured

## Evolution Notes

- Provides minimal ontology for entire axionic project
- Avoids getting bogged down in metaphysical debates
- Enables focus on agency, ethics, alignment without prior commitments
- Shows influence of Wittgenstein (meaning as use), Quine (ontological relativity)
- Presages agent-relative frameworks developed later
- Demonstrates philosophical parsimony as methodological virtue
- Important for AI: agents and interpretive processes, not minds vs machines
- Circular but not vicious: acknowledged circularity vs hidden assumptions

## Cross-References



## Open Questions

- Can truly minimal agents (thermostats, bacteria) count as "interpretive"?
- What's the relationship between this ontology and physics?
- Does circularity eliminate possibility of ontological progress?
- How does this ontology handle mathematical/logical objects?
- Can multiple circular ontologies be incommensurable?
- What grounds preference for this particular circular structure?
- How does emergence fit into process-based framework?
- Does agent-interpretation go all the way down (panpsychism)?
