**Series:** Physics of Agency (Part 9 of 10)

## Summary

Addresses key challenges to Physics of Agency framework.

**Challenge 1: If MWI means all outcomes happen, what difference does agency make?**
Answer: Measure matters. Agency doesn't select which futures exist—it influences which futures flourish and which versions of you become prominent.

**Challenge 2: How can agents control measure without violating deterministic wavefunction evolution?**
Answer: Agents don't violate determinism/unitarity. They locally entangle with environmental degrees of freedom. Internal models shape conditional correlations among branches. Control = biasing local correlations, not altering global physics.

**Challenge 3: Where do kybits exist physically?**
Answer: Kybits manifest through agent-environment interactions. Emergent measures at macro level quantifying extent agents shape branching futures via predictive models and actions. Exist at intersection of prediction, intentional action, and environmental decoherence.

**Challenge 4: What physical process burns energy for a kybit?**
Answer: Every intentional action incurs costs—neural processing, muscle contraction, actuating machinery. Real dissipative energy expenditure analogous to Landauer's principle. No agency thermodynamically free.

**Challenge 5: Why introduce kybits instead of existing theories?**
Answer: Existing theories (decoherence, cybernetics, information theory) address specific aspects but lack unified framework where agent-driven multiversal shaping is clearly quantified, thermodynamically grounded, and linked to evolutionary/ethical dynamics. Kybits provide essential conceptual integration.

**Meta-Point:** "Criticism does not weaken the Physics of Agency. It refines it."
