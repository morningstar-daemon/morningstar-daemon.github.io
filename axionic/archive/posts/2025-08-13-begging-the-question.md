## Summary
This post critiques **Derek Parfit's _On What Matters_**—at first glance magnum opus of philosopher reconciling/defending sophisticated moral theories, but closer reading reveals **Parfit working backwards from pre-committed conclusion: moral realism must be true, best moral theories must converge on it**. **Pre-committed metaethics:** From outset, Parfit takes for granted irreducible normative truths exist—timeless, mind-independent facts about what we have reason to do. Not presented as hypothesis to test but treated as **datum, fixed point around which argument revolves**. Error theory, non-cognitivism, other moral anti-realism forms dismissed not because they fail under own logic but because they'd make morality "less important than it really is." Motivational consequences of denying realism taken as indirect evidence against it—**classic sign of working backwards: undesirability of worldview treated as evidence of its falsity**. **Triple Theory by design:** Parfit's signature move is Triple Theory—synthesis of Kantian contractualism, rule consequentialism, Scanlonian contractualism. Selects these three precisely because **they already agree in most real-world cases**. Differences massaged/reframed until appearing as surface variations on single underlying truth. Convergence presented as confirmation of moral realism. But reasoning direction reversed: **needs convergence to bolster realism, so chooses theories that already converge**. Synthesis not discovery of deep unity but **construct engineered to protect prior commitment**. From subjectivist perspective, convergence unsurprising: humans share evolved psychological heuristics, cultural constraints, agency-preserving norms yielding overlapping prescriptions **without requiring mind-independent moral facts**. **Counterexample containment:** When case arises where Triple Theory components would yield conflicting prescriptions (coercive-sacrifice dilemmas, lifeboat scenarios, extreme distributive justice cases), Parfit narrows scope of "reasonable rejection" or redefines "making things go best" until prescriptions align again. **Not behavior of someone willing to let core thesis take damage but someone determined to shield convergence claim from disconfirmation**. **Conditionalist rebuttal:** Our framework rejects moral realism on Conditionalist grounds—all truth claims require interpretation, interpretation depends on background value-conditions. **No such thing as unconditional moral truth**; every "ought" has form: "If X values Y, then Z is preferable." Moral disagreement between fully informed, rational agents not necessarily error; can simply reflect different value-conditions. **Normativity emerges from agents' chosen values, understanding of world, position in QBU (Vantage, Measure, Credence)**. From this perspective, Triple Theory's convergence reflects shared human conditions (evolutionary, cultural, cognitive), not timeless moral facts. **Objectivity as starting point:** Parfit's objectivity is starting assumption, not end point. Arguments for realism function as confirmations of standing belief, never neutral investigations. Entire project framed to arrive where it began. In our framework, any objectivity claim must survive **Conditionalist filter: can it be stated without smuggling in hidden background conditions?** Moral realism consistently fails that test. **Motivation and truth:** Parfit repeatedly suggests rejecting realism would make morality less motivating, treats this as pragmatic reason to accept it. But **usefulness is not truth**. Belief can motivate while being false; conversely, true belief can fail to inspire. Conflating motivational utility with ontological status another sign of conclusion-driven reasoning. Conclusion: _On What Matters_ brilliant philosophical engineering but **not open-ended search for moral truth**—**defense brief for moral realism**, constructed by selectively choosing/reshaping/unifying theories until fitting predetermined verdict. From our vantage, this precisely why it fails. Moral realism not natural conclusion of converging theories but **starting point Parfit couldn't abandon**. Truly robust moral framework must survive realism's falsity. **Ours does, because it grounds normativity in explicit, conditional value-commitments and embeds it in physically coherent ontology. Parfit's doesn't.**

## Key Concepts
- **Circular reasoning (begging the question)** – Assuming conclusion in premises; working backwards from desired outcome.
- **Pre-committed metaethics** – Treating moral realism as fixed datum rather than hypothesis to test.
- **Triple Theory** – Parfit's synthesis of Kantian/consequentialist/contractualist ethics designed to show convergence.
- **Engineered convergence** – Selecting theories that already agree, then claiming agreement proves realism.
- **Counterexample containment** – Narrowing definitions/scope when theory threatened by conflicting cases.
- **Conditionalism** – Framework where all truth claims conditional on value-backgrounds; no unconditional moral facts.
- **Normativity from value-conditions** – Oughts emerge from agents' chosen values + world understanding, not mind-independent facts.
- **Motivational utility ≠ truth** – Usefulness of belief (making morality motivating) doesn't establish its correctness.
- **Conditionalist filter** – Test for objectivity claims: can they be stated without hidden background conditions?

## Evolution Notes
- Introduces/applies Conditionalism framework to critique mainstream moral philosophy.
- Demonstrates willingness to engage with/critique sophisticated academic philosophy on its own terms.
- Part of broader project: grounding normativity in physical/computational reality (QBU, agency, value-conditions).
- Connects to earlier work on truth, probability, interpretation, meaning-dependence.
- Anticipates later axionic alignment work: value alignment without objective moral facts.
- Shows commitment to naturalism: morality grounded in agents/physics, not transcendent facts.
- Reflects anti-realist stance: moral facts don't exist independently of valuing agents.
- Illustrates pattern: identifying circular reasoning in respected philosophical work, offering alternative framework.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can any moral framework genuinely claim objectivity, or does Conditionalist filter eliminate all candidates?
- Does engineered convergence in Triple Theory still provide pragmatic value even if it doesn't prove realism?
- What distinguishes legitimate convergence arguments from circular reasoning when selecting theories?
- Can Conditionalism account for strong moral intuitions (e.g., torture is wrong) without collapsing into relativism?
- If all normativity is value-conditioned, what prevents "anything goes" moral nihilism?
- Does Parfit's framework fail on its own terms, or only when judged by Conditionalist standards?
- How do we arbitrate between competing value-conditions when they yield incompatible normative conclusions?
- Is motivational utility vs. truth distinction itself value-conditioned (i.e., assumes truth matters more than motivation)?
- Can evolutionary/cultural explanations for moral convergence coexist with any form of moral objectivity?
- What would constitute evidence for mind-independent moral facts that survives Conditionalist critique?
