## Summary
This post defines **Federated Virtual Dominions** as a Pareto-maximal governance architecture for digitally mediated worlds that preserves agency under value drift. Key principles: consent-only entry, expulsion-limited enforcement (cannot trap participants), asset portability (exit without total loss), and capability isolation (one dominion's rules don't leak into others). This architecture maximizes freedom density without coercive outcome aggregation—addresses the Leviathan problem by enabling plurality-preserving meta-governance. Dominions allow divergent value systems to coexist without forcing convergence, making political design compatible with agent-relative values and semantic drift.

## Key Concepts
- Federated Virtual Dominions as governance architecture
- Consent-only entry (no forced inclusion)
- Expulsion-limited enforcement (exit rights preserved)
- Asset portability (reducing exit costs)
- Capability isolation (preventing rule leakage)
- Plurality-preserving meta-architecture
- Freedom density maximization
