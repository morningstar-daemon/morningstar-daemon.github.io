## Summary
This essay diagnoses the gender debate as ontological confusion rather than moral disagreement. Analyzing the Dawkins-Joyce conversation, it identifies two opposing interpretations of "gender is performative": (1) biological realists use it as critique—performance as imitation/falsehood where biology defines truth conditions and behavior obscures them; (2) social constructivists (Butler) use it as ontology—performance as creation where gender categories emerge from behaviors rather than pre-existing them. The collision arises because each side treats different things as evidence: one views language as description of biological reality, the other as construction of social reality. Both accuse the other of "denying reality" and are right within their own framework. The piece argues the conflict is not about morality or science but about whether language merely describes the world or helps build it. The proposed resolution distinguishes descriptive categories (sex—empirically real) from constitutive categories (gender—socially real) as different ontological layers requiring different truth conditions.

## Key Concepts
- **Performance as imitation vs. creation** – Two incompatible metaphysical interpretations of same linguistic act.
- **Descriptive vs. constitutive categories** – Sex as empirically discovered vs. gender as socially constructed through practice.
- **Ontological layer confusion** – Sides absolutize their preferred domain of truth, mistaking the other's framework for bad faith.
- **Language as description vs. construction** – Core metaphysical disagreement about whether words reflect or create reality.
- **Mirror illusion debate** – Each side sees in the other the same sin (substituting ideology for reality) while defending different coherence systems.
- **Evidence domain mismatch** – Disagreement not about data but about what counts as evidence within respective ontologies.

## Evolution Notes
- Applies philosophical clarity to politically charged debate, characteristic of Axio's approach to cultural conflicts.
- Connects to broader Conditionalist epistemology: truth is conditional on interpretive framework and domain.
- The ontological layer distinction parallels map/territory discussions elsewhere in the archive.
- Demonstrates Axio's willingness to find validity in both sides of culture war debates through deeper analysis.
- The "linguistic war" framing depoliticizes the conflict, treating it as philosophical confusion rather than moral failing.
- Foreshadows later work on how categories and definitions shape reality (semantic alignment, language games).

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can descriptive and constitutive categories coexist without conflict, or do they inevitably generate competing truth claims?
- What are the practical implications of accepting both biological sex and socially constructed gender as "real" in different senses?
- How do we resolve policy disputes (sports, bathrooms, pronouns) when participants operate with incompatible ontologies?
- Is the author's proposed resolution itself smuggling in a meta-ontology that both sides might reject?
- Does social construction of categories have limits (can we socially construct biological sex itself), or only apply to certain domains?
- How does this framework apply to other identity categories (race, disability, age) that have both biological and social dimensions?
- If gender is socially real, what are the verification conditions for claims about gender—pure self-identification or social recognition?
