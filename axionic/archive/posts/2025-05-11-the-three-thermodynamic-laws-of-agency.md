**Date:** 2025-05-11  

## Summary

Synthesis/recap of three thermodynamic laws established in Physics of Agency series: **(1) Law of Control Work**: Agency costs energy (E_min = C × k × T × ln(2)). **(2) Law of Agency Decay**: Without energy input, agency capacity decays (drift reclaims dominance). **(3) Law of Agency Limits**: Perfect control impossible (thermodynamic floor, noise, imperfect models). Reinforces foundational principles in concise form. Parallel structure to Laws of Thermodynamics emphasizes agency as physical phenomenon subject to same constraints as all physical processes.
