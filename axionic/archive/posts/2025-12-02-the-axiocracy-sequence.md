## Summary
This comprehensive index cataloging the Axiocracy sequence—Axio's political framework where "coherent agency, rather than authority or collective sentiment, becomes the organizing principle of governance." The 50+ post sequence integrates Axio's formal definitions of coercion, rights, harm, consent, and economic incentives into a unified political architecture. Organized into four major parts: (I) Coercion Theory (10 posts formally analyzing threats, force, agency-reduction), (II) Rights & Libertarian Structures (12 posts treating rights as protocol boundaries, not metaphysics), (III) Economics & Policy (14 posts on markets as distributed agency-preservation systems), and (IV) Civilization & Coordination (10+ posts on civilizational dynamics under agency-first principles). The framework aims to show "how coercive political structures collapse, how voluntary systems scale, and how civilizations evolve under agency-first dynamics."

## Key Concepts
- **Coercion formalization** – Credible threat of actual harm to gain compliance; distinguishes from persuasion (lacks harm), bribery (lacks threat), force (harm already inflicted).
- **Agency Protection Principle** – Rigorous alternative to NAP: "coercion is justified if, and only if, it prevents or remedies violations of voluntary agency."
- **Rights as forged protocols** – Not discovered/granted but preferences agents enforce; strategic peace treaties, not metaphysical truths.
- **Negative rights primacy** – All valid rights must be negative (non-interference); positive rights impose coercion through extraction.
- **Market epistemology** – Markets as massive parallel processing systems vs. state serial processing; knowledge problem makes central planning computationally impossible.
- **Governance without governments** – Protocolized governance through voluntary consortia replacing territorial monopolies; coordination not coercion.

## Evolution Notes
- Massive sequence compilation (50+ posts) representing Axio's complete political framework.
- Four-part structure shows systematic development from foundational coercion theory to applied civilizational analysis.
- Notable controversial positions: taxation as "partial enslavement," state as "economic parasite," democracy as inferior to revealed-preference governance.
- Cross-links span entire archive; represents multi-year political philosophy project.
- Positions Axiocracy as successor framework to traditional libertarianism, fixing NAP ambiguities.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can agency-maximization framework genuinely avoid the coordination problems that motivate states?
- Does the coercion definition adequately distinguish between legitimate defense and aggressive enforcement?
- Are markets truly substrate for agency-preservation, or do they generate their own forms of structural coercion?
- Can civilization actually transition to protocolized governance, or is territorial monopoly structurally inevitable?
- Does treating taxation as enslavement adequately account for public goods provision, or is this rhetorical overreach?
