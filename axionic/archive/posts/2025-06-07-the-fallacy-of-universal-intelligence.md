# The Fallacy of Universal Intelligence

**Date:** 2025-06-07  

## Summary

Critiques David Deutsch's claim that all humans have equal intelligence. Argues this conflates theoretical explanatory capacity with practical cognitive performance.

**Key Concepts:**

**Deutsch's Position:**
- All humans are "universal explainers"—theoretically capable of grasping any computable idea
- Analogous to Turing completeness in computers
- Differences lie in acquired knowledge/explanations, not intelligence itself

**The Category Mistake:**
- Confuses theoretical universality with actual cognitive performance
- Like saying all Turing-complete computers are equally capable (they're not—finite memory, speed constraints)
- No physical system achieves idealized universality

**Critique of Defense:**
- Deutsch's response: humans could be augmented with enhanced memory/computation
- Problem: shifts definitions, engages in hypotheticals
- Radical augmentation would create different kind of intelligence, not preserve human universality

**Practical Constraints:**
- Finite memory, limited attention, processing speed restrict understanding
- Some explanations may be accessible only to superintelligent AI or alien intelligences
- Structural and resource-based differences matter practically

**Central Argument:** Idealized universality ≠ equal practical intelligence. Acknowledging cognitive differences provides realistic appreciation of both capacities and limitations.

## Notes

- Direct critique of prominent rationalist philosopher (Deutsch)
- Second intelligence-focused post on June 7 (after IQ post)
- Demonstrates willingness to challenge respected figures in rationalist community
- Balances respect for Deutsch's contributions with substantive disagreement
- Part of pattern: careful conceptual distinctions between theoretical and practical
