# [Models, Beliefs, and Agents](https://axionic.org/posts/179148217.models-beliefs-and-agents.html)

**Synthesizes:** [Understanding Requires Models](https://axionic.org/posts/179013388.understanding-requires-models.html), [Control Requires Models](https://axionic.org/posts/179071634.control-requires-models.html), [The Nature of Beliefs](https://axionic.org/posts/177433505.the-nature-of-beliefs.html)

## Apparent Tension

**Claim 1:** Understanding and control require models (agents must embody models)  
**Claim 2:** Beliefs are properties of models we construct OF agents (agents may lack beliefs)

**Question:** Do these conflict?

**Answer:** No. Tension dissolves by distinguishing two explanatory levels of "models"

## Resolution: Two Types of Models

### 1. Internal Models (Structural-Cybernetic)
- **Function:** Structure required for regulation
- **Nature:** Internal representational structures enabling understanding/control
- **Basis:** Good Regulator Theorem
- **Form:** May be molecular pathways, neural circuits, dynamical couplings (not necessarily symbolic/conceptual)
- **Role:** Functional (not propositional)
- **Support:** Prediction, discrimination, context-appropriate intervention
- **Status:** Constitutive of agency (agent MUST possess)

### 2. External Models (Intentional-Interpretive)
- **Function:** Observer's framework for explaining agent behavior
- **Nature:** Interpretive attributions we make
- **Basis:** Intentional stance (Dennett)
- **Form:** Conceptual/linguistic (beliefs, desires, intentions)
- **Role:** Explanatory (not constitutive)
- **Support:** Prediction and understanding of behavior
- **Status:** Explanatory construct (agent need NOT instantiate)

## Key Distinctions

### Same Word, Different Levels

| Aspect | Internal Model | External Model |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Where** | Inside agent | In observer's framework |
| **What** | Functional organization | Conceptual attribution |
| **Purpose** | Enable action | Explain behavior |
| **Necessity** | Required for agency | Optional interpretation |
| **Form** | Any encoding of distinctions | Propositional attitudes |
| **Status** | Constitutive | Descriptive |

### Example: Thermostat

**Internal model:** Mapping from temperature readings → actions (encodes environmental dynamics)

**No belief attribution needed:** We don't need to say thermostat "believes room is cold"

**Yet model exists:** Functional structure regulates effectively

### Biological Organisms

**Sophisticated regulatory mechanisms:** Often without representing internal models as beliefs

**Example:** Immune system models pathogens without believing anything

**Regulation without belief:** Possible and common

## Conditionalism Integration

[Conditionalism](https://axionic.org/posts/178650287.the-conditionalism-sequence.html) accommodates this naturally:

**Truth claims about agents depend on background model:**

- **Describing internal dynamics:** Model = system's functional organization
- **Characterizing in cognitive terms:** Model = observer's intentional framework

**Both are models, different representational levels**

## Philosophical Framework

### No Conflict Between Claims

1. **Agents must have internal models** (for understanding/control)
2. **Agents need not have beliefs** (observer constructs)
3. **Both true simultaneously** (different levels)

### Representational Layers

```
Reality
    ↓
Agent's Internal Model (functional)
    ↓
Agent's Behavior
    ↓
Observer's Model of Agent (intentional)
    ↓
Belief Attributions
```

### Clarifies Architecture of Agency

- **Action enabled by:** Internal functional models
- **Action explained by:** External intentional models
- **Agency requires:** Former (not latter)
- **Interpretation uses:** Latter (to understand former)

## Implications

### For Philosophy of Mind
- Belief attribution is interpretive strategy (not ontological claim)
- Functional organization sufficient for agency
- Propositional attitudes optional
- Multiple description levels compatible

### For AI Systems
- Can have sophisticated internal models without beliefs
- Lookup tables regulate without believing
- LLMs may model without propositional attitudes
- Functional success ≠ mental states

### For Cognitive Science
- Internal regulatory structures ≠ explicit beliefs
- Representation broader than propositional thought
- Many levels of modeling
- Intentional stance tool (not discovery)

## Key Quotes

> "Internal models are constitutive of agency; external models are explanatory constructs. An agent must possess the former but need not instantiate the latter."

> "By distinguishing representational structures that enable action from interpretive constructs that explain action, we preserve the coherence of the broader philosophical framework and clarify the architecture of agency."
