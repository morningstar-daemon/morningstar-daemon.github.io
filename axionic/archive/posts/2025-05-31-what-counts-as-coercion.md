## Summary

**Precise operational definition of coercion.** Used loosely to describe everything from violence to emotional manipulation. **Definition (Nozick-inspired)**: Coercion = credible threat of actual harm to gain compliance. **Four elements**: (1) **Credible** (believable to coerced person—mugger with loaded gun YES, child threatening to turn you into frog NO). (2) **Threat** (harm conditional on non-compliance—"if you don't X, then Y"—statement of unconditional harm isn't coercion). (3) **Actual harm** (something coerced agent has reason to avoid—imprisonment YES, disappointment NO unless backed by material consequence). (4) **To gain compliance** (purpose = induce specific behavior—"hand over documents or leak messages" YES; "you're going to jail" as punishment NO). **Composite example**: "If you don't testify, we'll expose your immigration status" = coercion (meets all 4). **Why matters**: Draws clean line between coercion and other influence (not persuasion—no harm; not bribery—no threat; not force—harm already inflicted). **Coercion = shadow of violence preserving illusion of choice.** Attempt to shape agency through fear. **Clarifying what counts** gains moral/political precision: distinguish legitimate defense from domination, voluntary agreement from coerced compliance, ethical boundaries from brute power.
