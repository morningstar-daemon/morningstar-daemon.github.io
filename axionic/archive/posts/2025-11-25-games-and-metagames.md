## Summary
This post introduces the conceptual framework of nested games and metagames as a fundamental lens for understanding decision-making and agency. Axios argues that games are not recreational artifacts but describe any system with goals, choices, constraints, and feedback—making life, institutions, culture, and evolution all game-like structures. The key insight is that every game sits inside a larger metagame that sets context and shapes what "winning" means at lower levels. The piece emphasizes how metagames mislead us when we misidentify which game we're actually playing (optimizing for truth when rewarded for loyalty, etc.). While acknowledging that games nest within games extensively, the post hints that the ladder doesn't go up forever but eventually reaches fundamental constraints.

## Key Concepts
- **Game structure** – Any system with goals, choices, constraints, and feedback; not figurative but architectural description of decision-making.
- **Nested hierarchy** – Every game sits inside a larger game (individual→family→community→nation→global; company→market→regulatory→political→cultural→evolutionary).
- **Metagame** – The game above the one you're examining, with distinct goals/strategies/rules that shape lower-level incentives when they propagate downward.
- **Incentive propagation** – Metagames only shape lower games when their rewards/penalties flow downward and alter strategic calculations.
- **Game misidentification** – The pattern where people optimize for local goals (truth, virtue, originality) while metagame rewards orthogonal outcomes (loyalty, coalition, conformity).

## Evolution Notes
- Sets up conceptual scaffolding that later posts will use to analyze specific domains (incentives, agency, values).
- The "ladder doesn't go up forever" hint foreshadows "The Ultimate Metagame" (likely post 87).
- Represents Axios's strategic thinking framework, applicable across multiple domains.
- The game-theoretic lens connects to earlier agency work but shifts focus from individual control to nested strategic contexts.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- At what level does the game hierarchy actually terminate? What are the "fundamental constraints"?
- Can metagame analysis itself become a trap—seeing games where simpler explanations suffice?
- How do agents navigate conflicts between different levels of the game hierarchy?
- Does game framing adequately capture non-strategic dimensions of human activity (aesthetics, relationships, meaning)?
