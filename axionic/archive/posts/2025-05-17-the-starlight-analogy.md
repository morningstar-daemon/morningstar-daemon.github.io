# [The Starlight Analogy](https://axionic.org/posts/163789945.the-starlight-analogy.html)

**Date:** 2025-05-17  

## Summary

Defends Many-Worlds against Occam's razor objection ("too many worlds"). Analogy: Stars emit ~10^44 photons/second, only handful reach our eyes—not "wasteful," just how physics works. Similarly, quantum branches radiate continuously; most unobserved doesn't make them "extravagant." **Key insight:** Occam favors simple *assumptions/rules*, not minimal *entity count*. MWI simpler in foundational assumptions (no collapse axiom) despite vast branches. Elegance = simplicity of rules, not frugality of entities. Nature doesn't minimize quantity, only complexity of laws. Effective popular-level defense linking everyday physics (starlight) to quantum interpretation debates.
