## Summary

**Inequality debates assume differences in wealth inherently cause harm/injustice (mistaken).** Real issue = poverty (absolute deprivation of resources necessary for meaningful agency). **Harm from lacking means to act**, not from someone else having more. **Illustration**: Billionaire near millionaire—neither harmed by other's wealth. Each person's ability to act, pursue goals, flourish remains intact. Disparity doesn't reduce agency or impose coercion. **Poverty genuinely harmful**: Lacking basic resources = severe constraint on meaningful choices. Agency diminished, potential curtailed. Harm from deprivation, not existence of richer individuals. **Coercive redistribution problem**: When policy aims at reducing inequality by redistributing wealth coercively, inherently causes harm through coercion. Reduces agency of those compelled to give under threat. Intended to alleviate harm, often merely shifts it, creating new harm. **Better approach**: Focus on poverty alleviation through voluntary, agent-bound methods. Respects agency/consent, preserves freedom while addressing deprivation directly. **Core insight simple yet powerful**: Inequality = measure of difference, not deprivation. To address real harm, enhance agency and address poverty—not enforce equality for its own sake.
