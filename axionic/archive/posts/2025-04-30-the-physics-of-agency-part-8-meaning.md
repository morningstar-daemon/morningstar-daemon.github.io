**Series:** Physics of Agency (Part 8 of 10)

## Summary

Explores implications of Physics of Agency for meaning, ethics, and evolution.

**Meaning:** In multiverse where all outcomes occur, meaning arises from intentional measure shaping. Your models, care, and energy investments enlarge certain futures/versions of yourself. Choosing intentionally produces real, physically measurable effects across branches.

"Meaning is not externally imposed. Meaning is the structure you carve into the distribution of measure through your intentional actions."

**Ethics:** Not abstract rules or divine commands, but physics of measure amplification. Good actions amplify desirable futures for yourself and others.
- Helping others maintain agency capacity amplifies branches where agency/creativity/life flourish
- Generosity amplifies futures of abundance
- Honesty amplifies futures of trust
- Courage amplifies futures resisting drift

"Ethics becomes the physics of future-shaping at scale."

**Evolution:** Natural selection shapes life to harvest free energy, build accurate predictive models, increase intentional action capacity. Evolution = universe's mechanism for developing agents effective at resisting entropic drift.
- Survival = preserving capacity to exercise kybits
- Intelligence = maximizing efficiency of future-shaping per energy unit
- Progress = expanding scope/depth/sustainability of agency

Evolution as "thermodynamic arms race for control of the future."

**Central Message:** You are thermodynamic agent sculpting flow of possible worlds. Your intentional actions resonate within reality structure itself—that, against entropy's tide, is meaning worth pursuing.

## Notes

- Bridges physics to ethics (major theme throughout archive)
- "Measure amplification" becomes foundational ethical concept
- Anticipates viability ethics, axionic obligations
- Questions about alternate timeline selves recur in later quantum ethics posts
