# Semantic Filters

## Summary

Extends the Chaos Sequence by introducing **semantic filters** as complement to exclusion filters. While exclusion filters prune incoherent bitstrings, semantic filters **assign lawful meaning** to survivors by mapping them to trajectories (state evolutions, measurement records, dynamical histories). The key insight: **exclusion defines what can exist; semantics defines what survivors mean**. Together they form two-step refinement: prune Chaos, then map remainder into lawful worlds.

**Exclusion vs. Semantics:**
- **Exclusion Filter:** Defines subset F of infinite binary sequences. String is coherent if passes filter (no forbidden blocks, contradictions, statistical constraints)
- **Semantic Filter:** Defines mapping S: F → T, where T = space of lawful trajectories. Each bitstring becomes measurement record, unfolding consistent with dynamics

**Refinement:** Exclusion narrows Chaos to set worth interpreting; semantics provides lawful meaning for survivors.

**Bits as Measurement Outcomes:** Each bit = quantum measurement outcome (0 or 1 from observable). Semantic filter specifies initial state and measurement operators. String corresponds to trajectory: |ψ₀⟩ → |ψ₁⟩ → |ψ₂⟩... updated by outcomes. **Coherence = lawful continuation under dynamics**, not just "absence of contradiction."

**The Danger of No Exclusion:** If exclusion excludes nothing, semantic filter must shoulder all weight—every random string mapped to some trajectory, including pathological ones. In practice, semantics would quietly reintroduce exclusion by mapping incoherent strings to trivial/null histories. **Thus exclusion remains essential.**

**Example:** Exclusion forbids "00." Semantics treats survivors as qubit records (0 = flip, 1 = identity). Surviving strings → valid qubit trajectories.

**Place in Arc:**
```
Chaos Reservoir → Exclusion Filters → Semantic Filters → Constructors → Life/Consciousness
```

## Key Concepts

- **Semantic filters** – Map coherent bitstrings to lawful trajectories
- **Exclusion-semantics complementarity** – Two-step refinement of Chaos
- **Bits as measurements** – Bitstrings as quantum measurement records
- **Lawful continuation** – Coherence as dynamics-compatible evolution
- **Trajectory space T** – Set of all lawful state evolutions

## Evolution Notes

Refines Chaos Sequence by distinguishing negative filtering (exclusion) from positive interpretation (semantics). Shows Axio's framework becoming more sophisticated—not just "what survives?" but "what does survival mean?" Connects to later alignment work where AI behavior must be both coherent and meaningful.

## Open Questions

Can we formalize "lawful dynamics"? Are all semantic filters deterministic? How do we handle probabilistic semantics?
