# What Counts as a Belief

**Date:** 2025-06-10  

## Summary

Rigorous definition of belief within axionic framework. Integrates Credence/Measure distinction, Conditionalism, and pragmatic action-orientation.

**Key Concepts:**

**Definition:** A belief is an agent's assignment of sufficiently high subjective probability (Credence) to a proposition or pattern, robust enough to guide practical decisions, predictions, and actions.

**Three Core Attributes:**

**1. Subjective Probability (Credence):**
- Quantifies rational uncertainty, not objective likelihood
- Measure = objective probabilities across quantum timelines
- Credence = personal endorsement strength
- High credence required (never absolute certainty)
- Reflects evolutionary purpose: guiding effective action amid uncertainty

**2. Actionable Consequences:**
- Beliefs not intellectual ornaments—have concrete effects
- Proposition becomes belief when it shapes decisions/predictions/behaviors
- Ideas that don't inform action = idle speculation, not beliefs
- Must translate into action to serve adaptive purpose

**3. Conditional Dependence:**
- Beliefs rely on explicit/implicit contextual assumptions (Conditionalism)
- No unconditional truth claims
- Format: "Given conditions X, proposition Y warrants high credence"

**Practical Illustration:**
Mugger scenario: victim's credence that concealed weapon is real crosses threshold where compliance becomes rational. Credence → belief when it guides action (handing over wallet).

**Philosophical Significance:**
- Highlights pragmatic and evolutionary utility of beliefs
- Promotes intellectual humility (limits to certainty)
- Enhances both philosophical discourse and practical reasoning
