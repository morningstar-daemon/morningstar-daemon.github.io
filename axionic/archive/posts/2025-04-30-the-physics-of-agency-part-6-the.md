# The Physics of Agency, Part 6: The Law of Agency Limits — Perfect Control Is Impossible

**Date:** 2025-04-30  
**Series:** Physics of Agency (Part 6 of 10)

## Summary

Establishes third thermodynamic law: perfect, frictionless control over future outcomes is physically impossible.

**Law of Agency Limits:** As free energy approaches zero, agency capacity approaches zero. Perfect control (infinite kybits without cost) is impossible. Every act of agency requires minimum energy expenditure: E_min > 0.

**Why Perfect Control Impossible:**
- Physical systems never entirely isolated from noise
- Predictive models inherently imperfect and costly
- Prediction/action require irreversible physical processes generating entropy

Even under ideal conditions, agents must expend finite energy to steer outcomes. "Infinite agency is an illusion. Frictionless will does not exist."

**Real-World Implications:**
- Supercomputers expend massive energy simulating futures
- Human brains use substantial resources to plan/decide/act
- All organisms/civilizations face energy-imposed limits

**Key Insight:** Agency meaningful precisely because it's limited and costly. We exert influence by continuously working against universe's tendency toward disorder. Perfect victories impossible, but meaningful victories achievable—locally, temporarily, purposefully.

## Notes

- Parallels Third Law of Thermodynamics (unattainability)
- Anticipates later work on bounded rationality, satisficing
- "Meaningful victories" theme recurs in ethics/politics work
- Rejects both deterministic fatalism and libertarian free will
