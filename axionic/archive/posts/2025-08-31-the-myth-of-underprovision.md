# The Myth of Underprovision

## Summary
This post deconstructs the economic orthodoxy that markets inherently "underprovide" public goods, arguing this claim is ideological rather than empirical. The standard economic narrative holds that public goods (non-rivalrous and non-excludable) lead to free-riding and thus require state intervention through coercive taxation. Axio demonstrates this conclusion is built into the model's assumptions—specifically that voluntary cooperation fails and that planners know the "optimal" provision level. Historical evidence contradicts this: British lighthouses were privately funded through port fees, roads operated as toll-based turnpikes, education flourished through churches and guilds, and legal systems emerged from voluntary associations (medieval Iceland, frontier zones). The sleight of hand is defining "underprovision" as "less than what a planner's social welfare function demands"—a political judgment masquerading as objective analysis. Markets actually reveal what people value enough to pay for voluntarily. As technology evolves (micropayments, blockchains), supposed non-excludability becomes trivially solvable. What economists call "underprovision" is simply provision in unfamiliar, decentralized forms that don't conform to state templates. The post connects to McCloskey's marginalist insight that you only owe at the margin, not for the whole past—similarly, markets provide at the margin according to voluntary demand. Accepting the underprovision myth hands the state a blank check; rejecting it reveals voluntary cooperation as the actual arrangement free people choose.

## Key Concepts
- **Public Goods Theory Critique** – The standard economic claim of market failure with public goods embeds statist assumptions from the start.
- **Historical Counterexamples** – Lighthouses, roads, education, law, and science were all successfully provided through voluntary mechanisms.
- **Underprovision as Ideology** – Defining "insufficient" provision relative to a planner's preference function is political judgment, not objective analysis.
- **Revealed Preferences** – Markets show what people actually value enough to pay for voluntarily, not what theorists think they should want.
- **Technological Exclusion** – Modern technology (micropayments, blockchains) makes exclusion trivial for formerly "non-excludable" goods.
- **Coercion Costs** – Taxation and state provision have real costs in destroyed agency and crowded-out alternatives that models ignore.
- **Marginalist Insight** – Following McCloskey, markets provide at the margin according to voluntary demand, not total "optimal" quantities.

## Evolution Notes
- Extends Axio's critique of statism by attacking a core economic justification for government intervention.
- Connects to earlier posts on economic parasitism and government monopolies by undermining their theoretical foundation.
- Prefigures later discussions of spontaneous order and decentralized coordination without central planning.
- Provides ammunition against AI alignment approaches that assume centralized control is necessary for optimal outcomes.
- Relates to technology and agency themes by showing how innovation erodes supposed market failures.
- Builds on Austrian/libertarian economic tradition while grounding it in historical evidence.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- How would modern blockchain-based mechanisms solve historical public goods problems that required centralized funding?
- Can we measure the agency destruction caused by coercive taxation and compare it to the supposed benefits of state provision?
- What proportion of current "public goods" could be converted to excludable, voluntary funding mechanisms with existing technology?
- Does the public goods argument survive the transition to digital goods where excludability is trivial and marginal costs are near zero?
- How do we distinguish genuine coordination problems from preferences that simply differ from what planners want?
- Could prediction markets or other decentralized mechanisms discover optimal provision levels without central planning?
