# Credo

## Summary
This post presents **personal statement of secular values**—manifesto affirming meaning/transcendence without supernatural beliefs. Opens: **"I do not believe in gods, ghosts, or immortal souls. The world does not whisper secrets from behind a veil. No hidden masters, no cosmic judges, no eternal rewards or punishments. The universe is vast, indifferent, and real enough without those illusions."** Yet affirms **the sacred**—not sacred as untouchable myth but **sacred as worth defending, worth orienting life around**. **Four dimensions of the sacred:** (1) **Agency**—fragile, improbable spark of beings who can choose. (2) **Flourishing**—expansion of possibility, deepening of complexity, broadening of futures. (3) **Authenticity**—living without lies, without masks imposed by coercion or conformity. (4) **Truth**—fallible, conditional, human, yet still our only compass through chaos. **To be secular is not to be empty**—it is to **build meaning consciously, instead of inheriting it from priests or kings**. To be transcendent not to rise above matter but to **see further into its patterns, understand measure of futures, act in ways that ripple beyond vantage of the moment**. "I do not kneel. I do not pray. I do not seek salvation. But **I choose reverence**." **Objects of reverence:** (1) Life, intelligence, fragile continuity of agency against entropy of cosmos. (2) Possibility of futures not yet crushed by coercion or ignorance. (3) **Luminous act of choice**—branching moment where universe itself becomes different because we willed it. **Final declaration:** "This is my credo: **not belief in spirits, but fidelity to transcendence. Not obedience to gods, but commitment to values I know are chosen and conditional, yet luminous enough to live and die for. Not worship of the supernatural, but reverence for the natural made meaningful through agency.** The sacred remains. **We carry it ourselves**."

## Key Concepts
- **Secular sacred** – Affirming sacredness (worth defending, orienting life around) without supernatural beliefs.
- **Agency as sacred** – Fragile spark of beings who can choose as primary object of reverence.
- **Flourishing** – Expansion of possibility, complexity deepening, future broadening.
- **Authenticity** – Living without lies or coercion-imposed masks.
- **Truth as compass** – Fallible, conditional, human, yet only guide through chaos.
- **Conscious meaning construction** – Building values deliberately vs. inheriting from authority.
- **Immanent transcendence** – Seeing further into matter's patterns vs. rising above material reality.
- **Chosen yet luminous values** – Acknowledging values as conditional while committing deeply to them.

## Evolution Notes
- Personal manifesto crystallizing core philosophical commitments.
- Bridges secular philosophy and spiritual language—reclaiming "sacred" for naturalism.
- Builds on earlier work: conditionalism, agency protection, anti-authoritarianism, truth-seeking.
- Reflects influence of eternalist singularitarianism discussion—secular transcendence framework.
- Connects to broader project: grounding meaning/value in physical reality (agency, choice, futures).
- Shows emotional/aesthetic dimension of philosophical naturalism—not just intellectual position.
- Demonstrates commitment to **chosen values with full awareness of their conditionality**.
- Anticipates later work on axionic agency, sovereign kernels, reflective coherence.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can secular sacredness provide same psychological/social functions as traditional religion?
- Does acknowledging values as "chosen and conditional" undermine deep commitment to them?
- What distinguishes "luminous" chosen values from arbitrary preferences?
- Can collective secular sacredness emerge without institutional structure (churches, rituals)?
- Does reverence for agency/flourishing avoid anthropocentric bias, or is it inherently human-centered?
- How do we resolve conflicts between different agents' chosen values if all are equally conditional?
- Is "transcendence" meaningful concept in purely naturalistic framework, or does it smuggle supernatural assumptions?
- What prevents secular sacred from collapsing into nihilism when values recognized as contingent?
- Can "fidelity to transcendence" survive recognition that transcendence itself is constructed category?
- Does this framework adequately address existential questions (death, suffering, meaninglessness) for most people?
