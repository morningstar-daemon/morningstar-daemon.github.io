## Summary
This index post organizes the Axio archive's analysis of artificial intelligence into three progressive parts: predictive cognition, cognitive architecture gaps, and the threshold of artificial agency. It traces the journey from current LLMs as pattern predictors through the structural requirements for true minds, culminating in conditions for genuine artificial agency. The sequence bridges technical AI capabilities with philosophical questions about consciousness, intelligence, and the conditions under which machines might become agents rather than tools.

## Key Concepts
- **Predictive cognition** – The foundational layer: how current AI systems model patterns, correlations, and counterfactuals without true understanding.
- **Cognitive architecture gap** – The structural differences between prediction systems and genuine minds: self-modeling, goal persistence, and valenced experience.
- **Agency threshold** – The boundary conditions that separate coherent pattern generators from autonomous agents with genuine preferences and purposes.
- **Pre-agentic systems** – Current AI characterized by fluency without true decision-making, understanding, or persistent identity.
- **Sequence structure** – Organizing posts into coherent developmental trajectories rather than isolated insights.

## Evolution Notes
- Provides meta-structure for understanding Axio's AI analysis as a unified progression rather than scattered commentary.
- Explicitly frames current AI as "pre-agentic"—powerful but lacking the control loops required for genuine agency.
- Sets up the conceptual scaffolding for later posts on alignment, consciousness, and machine ethics.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- What minimum architectural features would elevate a predictive system to genuine agency?
- Can agency emerge gradually through architectural additions, or does it require fundamental redesign?
- How would we recognize the transition from pre-agentic to agentic AI in practice?
