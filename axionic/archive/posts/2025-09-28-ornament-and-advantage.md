## Summary

Sexual selection produces costly ornaments (peacock tails) signaling genetic quality. Cultural analog: conspicuous displays (art, philosophy, extreme sports) signal cognitive fitness. Not wasteful but adaptive signaling. Distinction between authentic signal (costly, hard to fake) vs cheap mimicry. Defense of cultural "waste" as fitness display mechanism maintaining evolutionary function in post-scarcity world.

## Key Concepts

- **Costly signaling** – Ornaments expensive enough to indicate genuine quality
- **Cultural fitness displays** – Philosophy, art, extreme pursuits as cognitive peacock tails
- **Authentic vs mimicry** – Real costly signals vs cheap imitations
