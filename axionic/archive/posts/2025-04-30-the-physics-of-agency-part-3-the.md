# [The Physics of Agency, Part 3: The Kybit — A New Unit of Control](https://axionic.org/posts/162485677.the-physics-of-agency-part-3-the.html)

**Date:** 2025-04-30  
**Series:** Physics of Agency (Part 3 of 10)

## Summary

Introduces the kybit as fundamental unit of control, analogous to the bit for information.

**Definition:** Kybits quantify intentional control using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between initial and final probability distributions:
- KL(P||Q) measures thermodynamic work required to rearrange probability distribution
- Always non-negative (zero only if distributions identical)

**Examples:**
- Forcing fair coin to heads: exactly 1 kybit (moving from 50/50 to 100/0)
- Biasing fair die: ~0.585 kybits (moving from uniform 1/6 to weighted distribution)

**Physical Reality:** Kybits represent real thermodynamic costs. Each kybit corresponds to minimum energy expenditure E_min = C × k × T × ln(2), analogous to Landauer's principle.

**Key Insight:** Just as bits measure information, kybits measure agency's influence on future outcomes.
