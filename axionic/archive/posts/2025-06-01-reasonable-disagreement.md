## Summary

**Meta-level insight: Reasonable people can disagree even with same information.** Despite rigorous definitions of harm/coercion/consent, disagreement persists. **Why?** Each definition fundamentally agent-relative and vantage-dependent, relying on subjective judgments. **(1) Harm**: Evaluating whether capacity to pursue valued goals genuinely degraded—what goals matter, significance of impact, whether impact = functional degradation can differ. Agents have diverse values, varying thresholds. **(2) Coercion**: Whether threat credible and aimed at compliance—credibility inherently subjective (influenced by experience, context, perceived intent). **(3) Consent**: Whether agreement informed, intentional, uncoerced—standards for adequate information, intentionality threshold, whether pressure crossed into coercion vary. **Evaluating requires modeling internal states** (beliefs, values, intentions)—inherently complex, uncertain. Different people, even in good faith, reach different conclusions based on differing assumptions. **This isn't flaw—it's feature** of moral/social reasoning. Acknowledges moral judgments contextual, depend on observers' frameworks, cultural values, experiences, informational vantages. Reflects **Conditionalism** (all truth claims conditional, rely on implicit background assumptions). **Precise definitions help but can't end debates**—enable pinpointing exactly where disagreements arise, identifying assumptions/interpretations underpinning differing conclusions. **Provides structured basis** for productive dialogue, mutual understanding, navigating complexities.
