## Summary
This post proposes upgrading political philosophy from liberty as core ideal to the richer concept of **agency**—defined as the capacity to intentionally choose and pursue goals. While liberty (freedom from coercion) is essential to agency, agency encompasses additional dimensions: **(1) Capability**—physical, intellectual, social abilities to execute meaningful choices; **(2) Opportunity**—access to meaningful and valuable choices. This resolves tensions inherent in pure liberty maximization, which conflicts with legitimate societal goals (security, justice, environmental protection, public health). Framework builds on established definitions: **harm** as any reduction of agency, **coercion** as credible threat of harm to gain compliance. Decision-theoretic principle: **interventions (even coercive) justified if and only if they produce net increase in overall agency** (Δ Net Agency > 0). This resolves libertarian blind spots: environmental regulations restrict liberty but preserve overall agency by preventing greater harm; public health measures (vaccinations, quarantines) restrict liberty temporarily but justified through net agency preservation. **Quantifying agency** as effective capacity for choice enables explicit reasoning about interventions. **Practical examples:** Immigration restrictions significantly reduce migrants' agency with minimal local gain, thus fail agency test; coercive redistribution generally reduces agency due to coercion involved, voluntary/mutually beneficial interventions remain justified. Framework aligns with Conditionalism and Physics of Choice, clarifying ethics by quantifying harm and delineating acceptable scope of political authority. Positions agency-centric approach as offering philosophical clarity and practical guidance—nuanced, internally consistent approach explicitly accounting for harm, coercion, genuine flourishing.

## Key Concepts
- **Agency upgrade** – From liberty (freedom from coercion) to agency (capacity + capability + opportunity).
- **Capability dimension** – Physical, intellectual, social abilities to execute choices.
- **Opportunity dimension** – Access to meaningful and valuable choices.
- **Harm as agency reduction** – Any diminishment of capacity to choose/pursue goals.
- **Coercion definition** – Credible threat of harm to gain compliance.
- **Δ Net Agency rule** – Interventions justified iff overall agency increases.
- **Resolution of tensions** – Framework reconciles liberty with other legitimate societal goals.
- **Quantification** – Agency as measurable effective capacity for choice.

## Evolution Notes
- Foundational framework for Axio's political philosophy—repeatedly referenced in later posts.
- Demonstrates synthesis of libertarianism with consequentialism (outcome-focused ethics).
- Connects to Physics of Agency—grounding political philosophy in physical/causal reality.
- Shows influence from decision theory, economics (capability theory, Sen's work potentially).
- Part of broader pattern: quantitative, objective approaches to ethics and politics.
- Positions as alternative to both pure libertarianism and collectivist frameworks.
- Reflects pragmatism—acknowledging legitimate reasons for liberty constraints.
- Sets up later critiques of both progressivism and conservatism as inadequate.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- How weight capability vs. opportunity in agency calculations—are they commensurable?
- Does net agency calculation inherently favor aggregation over distribution (utilitarian failure)?
- What time horizon for agency assessment—immediate vs. long-term agency impacts?
- How handle uncertainty in agency impact predictions—precautionary principle or expected value?
- Can agency framework accommodate non-rational agents (children, cognitively impaired)?
- Does emphasizing capability/opportunity risk justifying paternalistic interventions?
- How prevent "agency washing"—post-hoc rationalization of preferred policies as agency-maximizing?
- What constitutes "meaningful" vs. trivial choices—who judges value/significance?
- How reconcile individual agency with collective agency (nations, communities, humanity)?
