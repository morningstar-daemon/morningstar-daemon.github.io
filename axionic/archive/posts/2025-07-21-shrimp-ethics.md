# Shrimp Ethics

## Summary
This post critiques a utilitarian thought experiment claiming we should save 10¹⁰⁰ shrimp over a single human life, dismantling what Axio calls "elegant confusion" masquerading as moral arithmetic. Six systematic errors identified: **(1) Aggregation Fallacy**—Assumes ethical values aggregate linearly and indefinitely; multiplying trivial harm by astronomical numbers doesn't surpass meaningful ethical weight. Ethical significance not strictly additive—thresholds exist beyond which negligible moral values never yield meaningful weight. **(2) False Equivalence: Probabilistic vs. Intentional Harm**—Conflates tiny probabilistic risks (driving to get candy) with intentional infliction of harm/torture. Intentional harm violates agency directly and categorically; probabilistic harm, especially diluted risk in normal activities, involves no direct intention, thus no equivalent culpability. **(3) Sentience ≠ Ethical Agency**—Presumes sentience (capacity to feel pain) automatically equates to significant ethical standing. Ethical significance derives largely from **agency**—meaningful capacity to choose and affect future outcomes—not solely sensory experience. **(4) Qualitative Ethical Thresholds**—Robust ethics distinguishes entities by complexity and agency. Humans possess extensive causal agency, complexity, capacity for future-directed intentional actions. Shrimp, even in vast numbers, lack meaningful agency/complexity, categorically limiting ethical relevance. **(5) Misrepresentation of Infinite Human Value**—Actions revealing finite valuation don't constitute irrationality; sophisticated frameworks attribute finite but qualitatively superior ethical standing based on agency/complexity. **(6) Category Error: Long-run Aggregation**—Cumulative probabilistic actions don't equate morally to intentional harm. Ethical culpability bounded by intentionality and meaningful agency violation, not hypothetical aggregations stretched to infinity. Conclusion: Thought experiment reveals sophistry of naive aggregation ethics, not hidden moral irrationality. Consistent framework recognizes categorical distinctions based on agency, intention, complexity.

## Key Concepts
- **Aggregation fallacy** – Ethical values don't aggregate linearly/indefinitely; thresholds limit summation of negligible values.
- **Intentional vs. probabilistic harm** – Categorical ethical difference between direct harm and diluted risk.
- **Agency-based ethics** – Ethical significance derives from capacity to choose/affect outcomes, not just sentience.
- **Qualitative thresholds** – Categorical distinctions in ethical standing based on complexity and agency.
- **Finite but superior standing** – Humans possess finite ethical value qualitatively different from simple organisms.
- **Ethical sophistry** – Clever arithmetic mistaken for moral clarity through naive aggregation.
- **Category error** – Confusing types of moral consideration (cumulative risk vs. intentional harm).

## Evolution Notes
- Critique of naive utilitarianism, particularly Peter Singer-style aggregation ethics.
- Consistent with agency-based framework developed in "Upgrading Liberty" and related posts.
- Demonstrates Axio's commitment to qualitative ethical distinctions vs. purely quantitative approaches.
- Reflects anti-egalitarianism—not all sentient beings have equivalent ethical standing.
- Part of broader pattern: defending commonsense moral intuitions through rigorous philosophical analysis.
- Shows skepticism toward extreme thought experiments as revealing moral truth.
- Connects to later work on sentience, agency, sovereignty distinctions.
- Positions simplistic utilitarianism as insufficient for capturing ethical reality.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Where exactly do qualitative thresholds in ethical standing occur—humans vs. apes vs. mammals vs. insects?
- Is agency-based ethics anthropocentric bias, or genuine discovery of ethical reality?
- How measure agency objectively to ground ethical distinctions?
- What about marginal cases—infants, severely cognitively impaired humans lacking typical agency?
- Does rejecting aggregation undermine all consequentialist reasoning?
- Can any ethical framework coherently reject aggregation while remaining action-guiding?
- What prevents agency-based ethics from becoming circular—valuing agency because we value agency?
- How handle future artificial agents with vast agency but alien sentience?
- Does probabilistic harm aggregate differently than direct harm, or not at all?
