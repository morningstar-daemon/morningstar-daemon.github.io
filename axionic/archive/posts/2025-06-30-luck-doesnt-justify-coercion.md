## Summary
This post argues luck doesn't ethically justify coercive redistribution, responding to claim that if success results primarily from inherited traits (individuals lack control), redistributive policies become more justified. While coherent within egalitarian/Rawlsian frameworks, fails under rigorous philosophical scrutiny when clarifying agency and coercion. Distinguishes two claims: (1) success depends significantly on luck—genetic inheritance, upbringing, environment (true but ethically irrelevant for coercion justification); (2) luck-based disparities justify coercive redistribution (false). Origin of success—genetic, environmental, deliberate effort—doesn't morally permit coercion against anyone. Coercion precisely defined as credible threat of harm to gain compliance. Any redistribution involving coercion inherently reduces agency, intrinsically harmful and ethically impermissible. Underlying ethical issue: not whether success earned/inherited, but whether individuals have sufficient agency. Poverty (lack of basic agency to pursue meaningful choices) genuinely harmful requiring address. However, inequality itself not inherently problematic if arising without coercion. Attempting inequality correction through coercive redistribution introduces harm precisely by restricting voluntary agency. Voluntary redistribution—charitable giving, community cooperation, non-coercive structures—entirely ethical and commendable, respecting agency while effectively addressing genuine poverty/deprivation. Neither genetic nor environmental luck justifies coercive redistribution. Rigorous ethical framework places agency core, consistently rejecting coercion. Redistribution must always be voluntary to remain ethical/effective.

## Key Concepts
- **Luck irrelevance** – Origin of success (luck vs. effort) doesn't justify coercion.
- **Agency primacy** – Voluntary agency as central ethical value; coercion intrinsically harmful.
- **Poverty vs. inequality** – Poverty (agency lack) problematic; inequality per se ethically neutral if non-coercive.
- **Voluntary redistribution** – Ethical alternative respecting agency while addressing deprivation.
- **Coercion definition** – Credible threat of harm to gain compliance, always agency-reducing.
- **Rawlsian critique** – Egalitarian frameworks fail when agency/coercion rigorously defined.

## Evolution Notes
- Applies foundational agency/coercion definitions to contemporary policy debate (redistribution).
- Demonstrates pattern: deriving policy positions from first principles, not intuition/convention.
- Reflects consistent libertarian stance: voluntary coordination superior, coercion impermissible.
- Connects to earlier work: What Counts as Harm, What Counts as Coercion, inequality critique.
- Anticipates later governance/justice work: voluntary systems, agency protection.
- Shows willingness to challenge progressive consensus from principled position.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Does the framework adequately address cases where luck creates insurmountable barriers (severe disability)?
- Can voluntary charity scale to address systemic poverty at societal level?
- How do we handle collective action problems requiring coordinated redistribution (pandemic relief)?
- Does strict anti-coercion stance permit any taxation whatsoever for any purpose?
- Can the poverty/inequality distinction hold when inequality creates relative deprivation harms?
- What mechanisms ensure voluntary redistribution reaches genuinely needy versus appealing causes?
- How does the framework handle inherited wealth concentrations creating power imbalances?
