## Summary
This comprehensive post examines nine major critiques of free-market capitalism, providing robust free-market counterarguments for each. Acknowledges capitalism (idealized free-market form, not crony capitalism) has dramatically improved living standards, accelerated innovation, facilitated global prosperity, yet addresses structural critiques thoughtful advocates must confront. **(1) Short-termism**: Critique—capitalism prioritizes immediate profits, undermining sustainability. Response—short-term incentives arise from regulatory uncertainty or poor governance; robust property rights incentivize long-term investments. **(2) Externalities/tragedy of commons**: Critique—markets fail to internalize costs (pollution, degradation). Response—externalities reflect unclear property rights; clarifying/enforcing rights internalizes costs via market mechanisms (Coase theorem). **(3) Information asymmetry**: Critique—consumers lack vital information, causing market failures. Response—markets evolve institutions (rating agencies, reputation systems) to mitigate asymmetry; excessive regulation suppresses organic solutions. **(4) Systemic inequality**: Critique—wealth inequality reinforces over time, undermining opportunity. Response—inequality itself not problematic, poverty is; market-driven inequality signals productivity; free markets enable continuous mobility reshuffling. **(5) Public goods undersupply**: Critique—markets undersupply defense, health, research. Response—private/voluntary arrangements historically provided many public goods; voluntary mechanisms address free-rider problem without coercion. **(6) Boom-bust instability**: Critique—free markets lead to cyclical volatility, crises. Response—instability results from monetary interventions, credit expansions, moral hazards; genuine corrections efficiently reallocate capital. **(7) Moral/cultural erosion**: Critique—capitalism commodifies relationships, erodes communal values. Response—markets reflect rather than dictate values; societies free to maintain norms alongside transactions. **(8) Addictive consumption**: Critique—profit incentives encourage harmful behaviors. Response—consumption choices individual decisions; labeling addictive reflects paternalism; education/transparency address problems without reducing freedom. **(9) Winner-take-all dynamics**: Critique—markets favor monopolies suppressing competition. Response—persistent dominance stems from regulatory capture, IP enforcement—not inherent market tendencies; competitive dynamics challenge incumbents absent interventions. Conclusion: Market solutions frequently offer more robust, effective, ethically consistent answers than government interventions.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can property rights truly solve all externality problems, or are some inherently non-excludable?
- Does Coase theorem work at planetary scale (climate change)?
- How prevent regulatory capture without regulation?
- Can voluntary mechanisms provide genuinely universal public goods?
- What about irreversible harms (extinction, catastrophic risks)?
