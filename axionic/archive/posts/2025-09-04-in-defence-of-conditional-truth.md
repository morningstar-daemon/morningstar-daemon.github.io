## Summary
This foundational post articulates Axio's philosophy of conditionalism as an escape from the false dichotomy between absolutism and relativism. In response to Alan S. Rome's "In Defence of Absolute Truth" in Quillette, Axio argues both positions collapse: absolutism denies its hidden assumptions while relativism denies meaningful cross-perspective discourse. The core insight: every truth claim requires interpretation, every interpretation requires background conditions, therefore only conditional statements meaningfully possess truth values. Truth is neither absolute ("X is true, full stop") nor purely relative ("X is only true for me"), but conditional validity relative to specified assumptions. Simple claims like "water boils at 100°C" compress entire lattices of conditions: sea level, standard pressure, pure H₂O, calibrated instruments, ignoring impurities. Relativism fails by making an absolute claim ("all truth is relative") that self-contradicts and dissolves cross-cultural critique. Absolutism fails by masquerading contested assumptions as eternal truths, making reasoning fragile and disputes interminable. Conditionalism preserves objectivity without absolutism and contextual sensitivity without relativism. "Slavery is wrong" becomes: given that we value agency, autonomy, and flourishing, slavery violates those values. This conditional form is stronger because it makes grounding explicit and debatable. Society requires not absolute truth but shared conditional frameworks—logic, mathematics, science, and human rights function as robust because their conditions are widely adopted and indispensable. They act as if absolute within our vantage while remaining conditional at meta-level. Instead of climbing toward impossible Absolutes, we refine and expand conditional frameworks. Conditionalism alone provides solid ground between dogmatism and nihilism.

## Key Concepts
- **Conditionalism** – Truth as conditional validity relative to explicitly specified background assumptions and interpretive frameworks.
- **False Dichotomy Escape** – Absolutism and relativism both fail; conditionalism provides the genuine middle path.
- **Hidden Assumptions** – All "simple truths" compress lattices of unstated background conditions that must be surfaced.
- **Relativism's Self-Contradiction** – Claiming "all truth is relative" makes an absolute claim that eats itself.
- **Absolutism's Blindness** – Pretending to speak without conditions while smuggling them in creates fragile reasoning.
- **Conditional Strength** – Making grounding explicit enables critique and improvement rather than weakening claims.
- **Shared Conditional Frameworks** – Society requires not absolutes but widely adopted, indispensable conditional frameworks.
- **Meta-Level Awareness** – Frameworks act as if absolute within practice while remaining conditional at meta-level.
- **Progressive Refinement** – Truth-seeking means expanding and refining conditional frameworks, not reaching absolutes.

## Evolution Notes
- This is a foundational philosophical post that will ground much of Axio's later work on epistemology and ethics.
- Connects to earlier "Conditionalism" post (162831503) that introduced the concept.
- Prefigures the "Conditionalism Sequence" that will systematically develop this philosophy.
- Essential for understanding Axio's approach to moral claims, scientific truth, and philosophical argument.
- Provides the epistemological foundation for axionic alignment's conditional constraints approach.
- Distinguishes Axio's position from both postmodern relativism and traditional rationalist absolutism.
- Will be referenced throughout later posts when making conditional ethical or scientific claims.
- Central to understanding how Axio can make strong normative claims without appealing to moral absolutes.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- How do we determine which conditional frameworks are "indispensable" versus merely conventional?
- Can all meaningful truth claims be fully conditionalized, or are there irreducible primitives?
- What meta-level framework judges between competing conditional frameworks—is that itself conditional?
- How does conditionalism handle logical/mathematical truths that seem less obviously conditional?
- Can AI systems be trained to explicitly represent and reason about conditional frameworks?
- Does conditionalism resolve classic philosophical puzzles (skepticism, induction, moral realism) or relocate them?
- How do we avoid infinite regress when conditionalizing the conditions themselves?
- Is there pragmatic value in treating some conditionals "as if" absolute for practical reasoning?
