## Summary

Introduces concise terminology to clarify fundamental political tension: **Archists** (support special rights/privileges for State) vs **Anarchists** (oppose state privileges, insist all legitimacy derives from individual rights). Most people claim non-authoritarianism yet hold archist assumptions implicitly. Argues the fundamental disagreement is axiomatic (order/stability vs autonomy/consistency), but explicitly exposing it enables clearer discourse.

**The Contradiction:**

Most people:
- Claim they aren't authoritarian
- Yet consistently criticize anti-authoritarian stances
- Reveals implicit archist assumptions not explicitly acknowledged

**Terminology:**

**Archist:**
- Individuals/views supporting special rights or privileges for State (authority structures)
- Implicit or explicit support

**Anarchist:**
- Individuals/views opposing special rights or privileges for State
- Insist all ethical legitimacy derives exclusively from individual rights

**Archist Thinking:**

Typical assumptions:
- State needs special rights to maintain law, order, social stability
- Without these privileges (coercion, monopoly on force, immunity from accountability), society risks chaos

**Anarchist Thinking:**

Counter-assertions:
- Ethical rules must apply symmetrically
- State has no moral privileges above individual rights
- Granting special rights inherently distorts justice, incentivizes abuse, reduces autonomy

**Can This Be Resolved?**

**Logical Clarity:**
- Can expose internal contradictions
- Archists must justify ethical asymmetry logically
- Anarchists can highlight logical inconsistencies ("Why can State coerce but individuals cannot?")

**Empirical Evidence:**
- Historical comparisons (archist vs less-archist societies)
- Socioeconomic data: Stability, corruption, prosperity, flourishing
- Can test real-world outcomes

**The Axiomatic Core:**

Logic and evidence alone can't fully resolve disagreement. Heart of matter is axiomatic:

**Archists prioritize:**
- Collective order and stability
- Accept risk of injustice and ethical inconsistency

**Anarchists prioritize:**
- Individual autonomy and ethical consistency
- Accept potential instability as necessary cost

**Value of Exposure:**

Explicitly revealing hidden assumptions and fundamental disagreements:
- Clarifies actual points of conflict (reduces superficial debates)
- Promotes intellectual honesty and consistency
- Facilitates constructive dialogue and pragmatic solutions

**Conclusion:**

Clearly revealing fundamental assumptions enables more meaningful conversations, clearer understanding, genuine intellectual progress—even if axiomatic disagreements persist.

## Key Concepts

- **Archism** – Support for state special rights/privileges
- **Anarchism** – Opposition to state privileges, symmetrical ethics
- **Ethical asymmetry** – Different rules for state vs individuals
- **Axiomatic disagreement** – Fundamental value priorities (order vs autonomy)
- **Implicit assumptions** – Unstated beliefs driving political positions
- **Symmetrical ethics** – Same rules apply to all agents
- **Hidden contradictions** – Claiming non-authoritarianism while supporting state privileges

## Evolution Notes

- Introduces key terminology used throughout archive
- Clarifies fundamental political divide underlying many debates
- Shows meta-political analysis: Not just arguing position, analyzing structure of debate
- Important for Axiocracy: Explicitly anarchist political philosophy
- Demonstrates commitment to ethical consistency (symmetrical rules)
- Acknowledges axiomatic nature of some disagreements (intellectual honesty)
- Framework for understanding why political debates often unproductive (different axioms)

## Open Questions

- Can archism and anarchism coexist (jurisdictional competition)?
- What about minimal state (minarchism) as middle ground?
- How to transition from archist to anarchist society?
- What about implicit "states" (dominant protection agencies)?
- Can large-scale coordination happen without archist structures?
- What about natural monopolies in force provision?
- How to handle external threats (defense) anarchistically?
