# The Physics of Agency, Part 5: The Law of Agency Decay — Entropy Always Wins

**Date:** 2025-04-30  
**Series:** Physics of Agency (Part 5 of 10)

## Summary

Establishes second thermodynamic law: without continuous energy input, agency capacity inevitably decreases.

**Law of Agency Decay:** In closed system without external energy, available kybits inevitably decrease over time.

**Mechanism:** C_available(t) ∝ E_free(t)  
As free energy decreases, control capacity decays. Eventually agent stops steering entirely—random drift reclaims dominance.

**Implications:**
- No perpetual agency
- No infinite choosing without cost
- No escape from thermodynamic consequences

**Sustained Agency Requires:** Continual intake of negentropy (new ordered energy):
- Food (biological agents)
- Fuel (machines)
- Computation (AI systems)
- Knowledge (informational resources)

Without replenishment, every agent eventually becomes a drifter. Agency is "temporary island in sea of entropy."

**Real-World Examples:**
- Starving organisms: survival narrows to reflex
- Depleted batteries: AI systems shut down
- Decision fatigue: exhausted humans lose flexibility

## Notes

- Parallels Second Law of Thermodynamics (entropy increase)
- "Drift always waits" becomes recurring theme
- Anticipates later work on viability ethics (agency preservation)
- Decision fatigue framed as physical phenomenon, not psychological weakness
