## Summary

Catalogs linguistic markers ("shibboleths") that signal progressive/left-wing ideological affiliation. From biblical origin (Judges 12:5-6), identifies terms across socialist anti-capitalism (late-stage capitalism, means of production), identity politics (intersectionality, lived experience), critical theory (hegemony, discourse), environmentalism (degrowth, extractivism), and anarchism (mutual aid, direct action). Core insight: Language serves as cultural membership test, revealing implicit assumptions and group loyalties.

**Key Categories:**
- Socialist: LTV, surplus value, alienation, commodity fetishism
- Internet/Youth: eat the rich, guillotine memes, fully automated luxury communism
- Identity Politics: privilege check, microaggression, problematic
- Academic: hegemony, deconstruction, praxis
- Environmental: Anthropocene/Capitalocene
- Anarchist: horizontalism, direct action

**Purpose:** Decoding shibboleths clarifies deeper ideological assumptions in contemporary political discourse.
