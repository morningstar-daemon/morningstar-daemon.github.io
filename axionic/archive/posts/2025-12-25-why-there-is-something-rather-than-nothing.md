## Summary
This post likely addresses the fundamental metaphysical question through the lens of agency and quantum branching. Within the Everettian framework (Axionic Commitments), "nothing" is not a coherent quantum state—existence follows from unitary evolution and measure distribution across branches. May explore why agents exist (agency as thermodynamic necessity) and how measure conservation relates to the persistence of evaluative structure.

## Key Concepts
- Everettian quantum mechanics and measure
- "Nothing" as non-coherent quantum state
- Agency as thermodynamic/structural necessity
- Existence and measure conservation
