# Defending Bayes, Part 9 (Interlude)

**Series:** Defending Bayes (Part 9 - Interlude)

## Summary

Critical conceptual clarification distinguishing Measure (objective physical probability) from Credence (subjective epistemic uncertainty). Both follow probability axioms but differ fundamentally in interpretation.

**Key Concepts:**

**Measure:**
- Objective physical probability embedded in reality structure
- Independent of observers or beliefs
- Intrinsic probabilities from physical laws and quantum mechanics
- Example: Branch weights in QBU framework

**Credence:**
- Entirely subjective
- Quantifies epistemic uncertainty—rational confidence given incomplete knowledge
- Applies to theories, logical propositions, conceptual frameworks, models
- Does NOT imply theories have "partial correctness" objectively

**Why the Distinction Matters:**
- Prevents confusion of credence as intrinsic property of theories (Deutsch-Hall's critique)
- Reinforces Conditionalism (truth claims meaningful only within frameworks)
- Ensures coherent use of probabilities in decision theory (EDT)

**Central Insight:** Probabilities follow mathematical rules, but knowing whether we mean objective Measure or subjective Credence profoundly affects reasoning and interpretation.
