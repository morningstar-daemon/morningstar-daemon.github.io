## Summary
This post analyzes "The Modeler Schema Theory of Consciousness" (Heile, arXiv:2512.01073), which proposes a cybernetic agent-structured architecture identifying a single computational locus of experience: the Modeler-schema. The system decomposes into three functional agents (Modeler constructs World Model, Controller selects actions/language/narratives, Targeter integrates attention) with regulatory schema-agent partners. Only the Modeler-schema generates qualia by receiving full World Model state, Focal Target stream, and sensory data for consistency checking. Key insight: the narrating agent (Controller) is not the experiencing agent (Modeler-schema). The theory explains qualia as internal comparison medium for detecting World Model inconsistencies, particularly during saccades. Proposes falsifiable experiment: permanent peripheral changes during saccades should generate bottom-up targets; temporary ones should not.

## Key Concepts
- **Modeler-schema as sole conscious locus** – Of six components (3 functional agents + 3 schema-agents), only Modeler-schema has structural properties for consciousness.
- **Diffuse awareness** – Panoramic, continuous, Controller-inaccessible content forcing conclusion that Modeler-schema generates awareness invisible to narrating self.
- **Qualia as calibration** – Not epiphenomenal but Modeler-schema's internal comparison medium for detecting mismatches across perception, recall, abstraction, multisensory integration.
- **Architectural decoupling** – Experiencing agent (Modeler-schema) separate from narrating agent (Controller); explains why reports of experience are always interpretations.
- **Saccadic consistency** – Humans make several saccades/second creating retinal shifts; qualia provide comparator maintaining stable world appearance.
- **Falsifiable prediction** – Permanent vs. temporary peripheral changes during saccades should have different detection rates; theory stands or falls on this.

## Evolution Notes
- Represents Axios engaging with formal consciousness research, positioning Axio framework as compatible with cybernetic/agent-based theories.
- The "experience is not emergent glow but functional operation" aligns with Axio's agency-first stance throughout archive.
- Reframes Hard Problem as design question: why does system need this operation? Answer: self-updating World Model requires comparator.
- Notable for embracing falsifiability—rare in consciousness theories and in Axio's typically unfalsifiable philosophical claims.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- If the experiment fails (temporary changes are detectable), does this falsify just the saccadic mechanism or the entire Modeler-schema theory?
- Can the Modeler-schema architecture account for altered states of consciousness (meditation, psychedelics, anesthesia)?
- Does "qualia as comparison medium" genuinely explain subjective experience, or just functional role?
- How does this theory handle philosophical zombies—systems with functional architecture but no qualia?
- What would implementing this architecture in artificial systems tell us about machine consciousness?
