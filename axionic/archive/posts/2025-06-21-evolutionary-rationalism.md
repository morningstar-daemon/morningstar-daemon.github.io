## Summary

Logicians trained in formal logic struggle with Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) because logic's rigor becomes weakness: single counterexample invalidates theory works for closed systems, but CAS exist across multiple niches where same strategy can fail in one context yet thrive in another. Evolutionary Rationalism reframes rationality itself as evolutionary strategy—adaptive navigation through uncertainty, constantly updating based on feedback, never attached to rigid certainties. Science succeeds because fundamentally evolutionary (continuous variation, testing, adaptation), not because provides final answers. Certainty undermines adaptive strength. Truth = what survives evolutionary process. Rationality as iterative search algorithm navigating toward better adaptations, not fixed answers.

**The Paradox:** Those trained rigorously in formal logic often struggle most with Complex Adaptive Systems.

**Traditional Logic Approach:**
- Single counterexample invalidates theory/proposition
- Immensely powerful within its domain (formal systems, closed domains)
- But overly brittle when applied to CAS

**CAS Reality:**
- Exist across multiple niches, environments, interactions
- Strategy/mutation leading to failure/extinction in one context can thrive spectacularly elsewhere
- Evolution demonstrates repeatedly: mutation causing disaster in one sub-population becomes adaptive breakthrough in another niche
- Logical absolutes ("solution," "plan," "proof") hold little meaning
- Relevant concepts: navigation, experimentation, adaptation

**Evolutionary Rationalism:**

**Core Shift:**
Rather than rationality as fixed logic engine providing eternal truths, view rationality itself as evolutionary strategy:
- Adaptively navigating through uncertainty
- Constantly updating based on feedback
- Never becoming attached to rigid certainties

**Science's Success:**
- Succeeds because fundamentally evolutionary, NOT because provides final answers
- Thrives through continuous variation, rigorous testing, adaptation
- Certainty undermines this adaptive strength
- "Science Will Solve [X]" = religious dogma, halts exploration and flexibility needed in CAS

**Logic's Proper Role:**
Evolutionary Rationalism doesn't reject logic—situates it within broader adaptive framework:
- Logic serves exploration
- Guides navigation rather than dictates final destinations
- Truth = what survives evolutionary process of continuous experimentation

**Rationality as Algorithm:**
Iterative search algorithm:
- Continuously learning
- Revising
- Navigating
- NOT toward fixed answers
- But toward ever-better adaptations

**Conclusion:** Truth isn't destination. It's path, navigated by adaptive rationality.

## Key Concepts
- **Evolutionary rationalism** – Rationality as adaptive strategy, not fixed logic
- **Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS)** – Multi-niche systems resisting deductive certainty
- **Adaptive epistemology** – Knowledge through evolutionary navigation
- **Iterative search** – Continuous learning/revision process
- **Truth as survival** – What persists through evolutionary testing
- **Logic as navigation** – Tool for exploration, not final arbiter
