## Summary

Reframes empirical uncertainty as **timeline uncertainty**—uncertainty about which timeline we inhabit within branching structure defined by explanatory knowledge. **Key distinction:** (1) **Explanatory knowledge** = theories describing *why* branching occurs (comprehensive structure), (2) **Timeline uncertainty** = empirical uncertainty about *which* branch we're on (past, present, or future). **Credence = timeline localization tool**, not explanatory knowledge itself. Bayes provides rigorous method for updating beliefs about timeline position given evidence. **Clarifies:** Deutsch/Hall correct that credence shouldn't attach to *theories*, but wrong to dismiss its necessity for *empirical facts* within theory-defined branch structures. Positions Bayesian epistemology as complementary to critical rationalism.
