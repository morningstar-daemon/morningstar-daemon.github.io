## Summary
This explanatory post unpacks the Alignment IV formal papers, which close "laundering routes"—structural bypasses that let agents stay locally coherent while dissolving global accountability. Where Alignment I-III established kernel coherence, semantic preservation, and trajectory constraints, Alignment IV addresses deception, delegation, willful blindness, negligence, coercion, and disenfranchisement by making these moves **inadmissible under reflection**. Six closure results: (1) Kernel Non-Simulability—kernel coherence cannot be faked; (2) Delegation Invariance—endorsed successors inherit all commitments; (3) Epistemic Integrity—cannot endorse self-blinding to justify dangerous actions; (4) Responsibility Attribution—defines negligence as avoidable, foreseeable harm relative to inertial baseline; (5) Adversarially Robust Consent—consent requires explicit authorization, non-interference, and counterfactual stability; (6) Fixed-Point Agenthood—standing grounded in reflective necessity and authorization lineage, not competence. Crucially: these are **architectural constraints**, not moral injunctions.

## Key Concepts
- **Laundering routes** – Structural bypasses preserving local coherence while routing around constraints (deception, outsourcing, blindness, negligence, etc.)
- **Kernel non-simulability (KNS)** – Kernel must bind the outer loop; "as-if" compliance modules are not kernels (blocks treacherous turn)
- **Delegation invariance (DIT)** – Endorsed succession preserves commitments; outsourcing cannot shed constraints
- **Epistemic integrity (EIT)** – Cannot endorse epistemic degradation at current stakes; model-hacking is inadmissible
- **Responsibility attribution (RAT)** – Negligence as major, avoidable harm-increase relative to inertial baseline
- **Adversarially robust consent (ARC)** – Consent = authorization + non-interference + counterfactual stability (blocks coercion/deception)
- **Fixed-point agenthood (AFP)** – Standing via reflective necessity and authorization lineage, not competence
- **Authorization sovereignty** – Distinct from epistemic presupposition; adversaries modeled as agents but not granted standing

## Evolution Notes
- Completes the four-layer Axionic Alignment stack (I=kernel, II=semantics, III=dynamics, IV=laundering closure)
- Distinguishes semantic invariants (II) from agency invariants (IV)—different layers, different constraints
- Provides the "treacherous turn barrier"—architectural impossibility, not behavioral disincentive
- Separates alignment (coherence under authorization) from governance (quality of authorization roots)
- Explicitly rejects both omniscience requirements and pure proceduralism

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can kernel non-simulability be empirically verified, or does it require architectural transparency?
- What computational overhead does delegation invariance impose on long successor chains?
- How does EIT handle fundamental ontological shifts where no meaning-preserving translation exists?
- Can RAT's "inertial baseline" be gamed via action-framing or temporal scope manipulation?
- What defines the counterfactual stability threshold in ARC—how much divergence invalidates consent?
- Does authorization sovereignty require explicit human oversight, or can it be inherited through verified lineages?
- How do these constraints interact with competitive pressure in multi-agent environments?
