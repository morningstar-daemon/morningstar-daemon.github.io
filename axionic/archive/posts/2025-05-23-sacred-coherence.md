# [Sacred Coherence](https://axionic.org/posts/164275423.sacred-coherence.html)

**Date:** 2025-05-23  

## Summary

Proposes **logical coherence as supreme value** ("Vulcanism" / Sacred Coherence). **Argument:** Coherence = prerequisite for meaningful thought, discourse, ethics; all other values (truth, integrity, justice) presuppose it. Unlike alternatives (religious faith, utilitarianism, cultural norms), coherence provides universally defensible, stable foundation. **Value hierarchy:** Coherence (top) → truthfulness/integrity → justice/compassion → cultural norms. Lower defers to higher in conflicts. **Practical implications:** Intellectual honesty, zero tolerance for double standards, explicit conditionalism. **Defends against critiques:** Not emotionally sterile (enables meaningful values); Gödel doesn't undermine (incompleteness ≠ incoherence); axioms pragmatically necessary (rejecting coherence self-defeating). Embodies Conditionalism's commitment to semantic consistency.

## Notes

- "Vulcanism" = memorable framing
- Explicit value hierarchy (unusual in philosophy)
- Foundational for later ethics work
