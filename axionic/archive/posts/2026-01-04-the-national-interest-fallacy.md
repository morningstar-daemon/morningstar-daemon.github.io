## Summary
Argues "national interest" is incoherent aggregation treating nation as agent with unified preferences. Nations are pluralities of agents with non-composable values; "national interest" rhetoric masks whose interests actually being served. Similar to civilizational optimization critique: attempting to optimize for aggregate obscures sacrifice patterns. Politicians/institutions claiming to act "in national interest" are either: (1) arbitrarily weighting some agents over others without admission, (2) imposing their own preferences under aggregate cover, or (3) enforcing outcomes benefiting power-holders while claiming broad representation. Axio alternative: explicit jurisdictional boundaries with consent-based coordination rather than presumed unified national will. Legitimate governance coordinates without aggregating into false unity. Makes explicit: no nation has interests—only people have interests, and treating collections as agents enables coercion.

## Key Concepts
- **Aggregation fallacy** – Nations aren't agents with preferences; rhetoric masks whose interests served
- **False unity** – "National interest" obscures sacrifice patterns and arbitrary weighting
- **Jurisdictional alternative** – Explicit boundaries and consent vs presumed unified will
- **Agency category error** – Treating collections as agents enables coercion under unity rhetoric
