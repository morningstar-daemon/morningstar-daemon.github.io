# [The Defending Bayes Sequence](https://axionic.org/posts/178434650.the-defending-bayes-sequence.html)

## Summary

Index post for 9-part sequence anchoring Axio's epistemology. Defends Bayesian reasoning not as mere statistical machinery but as logic of belief in branching universe. Extends from physics to philosophy of mind, demonstrating how rational agents maintain coherence across uncertainty, timelines, quantum branches. Integrates objective Measure (world frequencies in QBU) with subjective Credence (agent belief updates). Distinguishes four forms of uncertainty (logical, empirical, indexical, timeline). Reconciles Popper and Bayes. Clarifies theories aren't probabilities but beliefs about predictions are.

## Sequence Overview

**Part 1:** [Defending Bayes](163921757.defending-bayes.html)
- Bayesianism within Quantum Branching Universe
- Introduces priors, credence, Vantage within QBU
- How subjective belief (credence) relates to objective measure across timelines

**Part 2:** [The necessity of Bayesian updating](164130874.defending-bayes-part-2.html)
- Bayes' theorem = only coherent rule for rational belief revision
- Counters objections from Deutsch and Hall

**Part 3:** [Theories aren't probabilities—but beliefs are](164270270.defending-bayes-part-3.html)
- Scientific theories shouldn't be assigned probabilities
- Only credences about their predictions are probabilistic

**Part 4:** [Irreducible uncertainty and the vantage problem](164364452.defending-bayes-part-4.html)
- Yudkowsky's insight on irreducible uncertainty
- Connects to standing across multiple vantage points in QBU

**Part 5:** [Four forms of uncertainty](164433813.defending-bayes-part-5.html)
- Logical, empirical, indexical, timeline uncertainty
- Clarifies where Bayesian reasoning applies and where must be extended

**Part 6:** [Logical induction and conceptual credence](165064896.defending-bayes-part-6.html)
- Separates empirical randomness from conceptual uncertainty
- Connects Bayesian credence with Logical Induction framework

**Part 7:** [Reconciling Popper and Bayes](165065355.defending-bayes-part-7.html)
- Theories themselves not probabilistic
- Belief updates about evidence still must obey Bayesian norms

**Part 8:** [Measure and credence unified](165272096.defending-bayes-part-8.html)
- Integrates objective Measure (world frequencies) and subjective Credence (agent updates)
- Within Quantum Branching Universe framework

**Part 9 (Interlude):** [Measure vs. Credence clarified](165273153.defending-bayes-part-9-interlude.html)
- Distinction between objective and subjective probability
- Unifies Bayesianism with Axio's decision theory and QBU semantics

## Core Contributions

**Philosophical:**
- Bayesian epistemology grounded in quantum mechanics (QBU)
- Reconciles frequentist (Measure) and subjective (Credence) probability
- Resolves Popper-Bayes tension
- Extends Bayesianism beyond empirical to logical/conceptual uncertainty

**Technical:**
- Formal definitions of Vantage, Measure, Credence in QBU
- Four-way uncertainty taxonomy
- Integration with Logical Induction
- Decision theory for branching universes

**Meta:**
- Demonstrates how philosophical analysis can be systematically built from physics up
- Shows Bayesianism as consequence of coherent agency in QBU, not arbitrary choice

## Relation to Axio Framework

Foundation for:
- **QBU:** probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics
- **Agency:** rational belief updating as coherence maintenance
- **Conditionalism:** credence as conditional on vantage
- **Decision theory:** action under branching uncertainty
- **Alignment:** how agents should update beliefs to maintain goals
- **Truth:** epistemic norms for belief formation

This sequence establishes the formal epistemological machinery underlying all of Axio's philosophical claims.
