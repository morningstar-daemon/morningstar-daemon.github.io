## Tag Usage Guidelines

- **Multiple tags encouraged:** Most posts span several domains
- **Hierarchical relationships:** Some tags imply others (e.g., `ai-alignment` often involves `ethics` + `agency`)
- **Emergent patterns:** Watch for unexpected tag clusters revealing hidden connections
- **Cross-references:** Note when posts with similar tags reference each other
- **Evolution tracking:** Early vs late posts may treat same tags differently

Agency exists in constrained region with multiple stable regimes. Not binary property but location in multidimensional parameter space.

### [collapse-regime](../tags/collapse-regime.md)
Structural demands exceed capacity, agency disappears. Authorization chains break, renewal fails, deliberation terminates.

### [stasis-regime](../tags/stasis-regime.md)
Strong invariants preserve agency while suppressing adaptation. Accountability maintained but responsiveness declines. Intentional for critical infrastructure.

### [growth-regime](../tags/growth-regime.md)
Renewal and expressivity cheap enough for adaptation while maintaining coherence. Narrow region requiring ongoing balance.

Error that moral judgment requires redeemability. Axionic position: some actions warrant permanent condemnation regardless of reform potential.

### [resemblance-authority](../tags/resemblance-authority.md)
