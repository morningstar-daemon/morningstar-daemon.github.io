# [Opportunity Cost](https://axionic.org/posts/164882854.opportunity-cost.html)

**Date:** 2025-05-31  

## Summary

**Hidden dimension behind every sacrifice: opportunity cost.** **Definition**: Value of next-best alternative foregone when making choice. **Example**: Donating $100 to charity—true cost isn't just $100, but all other potential uses (health, family, business). Higher the value of best foregone option, greater the demonstrated commitment. **Revelatory function**: Exposes hidden inconsistencies ("I value family/health" but spend time elsewhere → opportunity cost of each scrolling hour = time not spent on stated priorities). **When we ignore opportunity cost, we mislead ourselves** about what our choices signal. **Practical application**: Brings unconscious trade-offs into awareness → enables aligning choices with genuine priorities (not professed ideals). **Conclusion**: Opportunity cost = yardstick of sincerity in valuation. To understand values (yours or others'), ask not just what is sacrificed, but what alternatives are consciously foregone. Only by facing this hidden dimension can we grasp real depth of priorities.
