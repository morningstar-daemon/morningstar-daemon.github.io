# [Yes, We Can Assign Probabilities to Counterfactuals](https://axionic.org/posts/165063201.yes-we-can-assign-probabilities-to.html)

**Date:** 2025-06-03  

## Summary

Response to Sara Imari Walker's claim that probabilistic causation is incoherent. Defends counterfactual probability assignment via Many-Worlds quantum mechanics.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Walker's claim:** "If causation is predicated on counterfactuals, then it cannot be probabilistic: we cannot assign probabilities to things that don't happen"
- **Quantum Branching Universe (QBU) framework:** Counterfactuals aren't hypothetical—they're actualized branches with measurable weight (Measure)
- **Ontological grounding:** What "doesn't happen" from our perspective does happen in other branches, making counterfactuals real
- **Causation as inter-branch relation:** Causation relates actual and counterfactual branches; probability is objective measure across multiverse
- **Metaphysical dependency:** Coherent probabilistic causation requires accepting multiverse realism

**Central Insight:** Probabilities can meaningfully apply to counterfactuals if one accepts richer metaphysical tapestry where counterfactuals genuinely exist.

- Engages with contemporary Assembly Theory debates
- Demonstrates axionic commitment to Many-Worlds as foundational metaphysics
- "QBU framework" terminology suggests this is established conceptual apparatus
- Illustrates how metaphysical commitments (multiverse realism) enable specific philosophical positions
