## Summary
This post, responding to Andrew Doyle's observation that authoritarianism is humanity's default state, establishes the fundamental philosophical opposition between liberalism and authoritarianism across three dimensions: authority vs. autonomy, coercion vs. consent, and dogmatic certainty vs. conditional epistemology. While the two systems are philosophically irreconcilable, practical nuances emerge around social order and law. Both aim for coordination, but authoritarianism imposes it coercively while liberalism seeks voluntary coordination. The distinction between "rule of law" (universal constraint) and "rule by law" (instrument of power) clarifies this. Axio applies a Conditionalist lens: liberalism uniquely embodies epistemic humility, acknowledging human fallibility and context-dependency without surrendering individual autonomy.

## Key Concepts
- **Authority vs. autonomy** – Authoritarianism centralizes decisions in hierarchy; liberalism prizes individual self-determination.
- **Coercion vs. consent** – Authoritarianism relies on credible threats; liberalism champions voluntary agreement.
- **Dogmatic certainty vs. conditional epistemology** – Authoritarianism asserts fixed truths; liberalism embraces context-dependent continuous scrutiny.
- **Rule of law vs. rule by law** – Liberals constrain power universally; authoritarians weaponize law as arbitrary instrument.
- **Voluntary coordination** – Liberal order emerges from mutual consent and rights, not imposed compliance.
- **Conditionalist lens** – All truths are contextually dependent; liberalism is uniquely suited to navigate uncertainty.

## Evolution Notes
- Establishes core political dichotomy central to Axio's entire political philosophy.
- Connects epistemology (conditionalism) directly to political structure (liberalism).
- Distinguishes liberalism as *method* not ideology—absence of dogmatism rather than competing dogma.
- This framework underlies all subsequent critiques of statism, socialism, and authority.
- Rule of law vs. rule by law becomes recurring analytical tool.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can liberal order survive without *any* coercive enforcement (e.g., for rights violations)?
- How much epistemic certainty can liberalism tolerate before becoming authoritarian?
- What minimal institutional structures are necessary for voluntary coordination at scale?
- Is there a thermodynamic/agency cost to maintaining liberal order that makes authoritarianism more "efficient"?
