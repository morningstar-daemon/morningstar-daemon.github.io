## Summary

Scrutinizes archist claim that centralized authority provides superior societal stability. Argues the claim is "conditionally valid but ethically problematic": Stability achieved through coercion carries enormous economic (35-50% tax burden), social, and moral costs. Challenges whether observed "stability" is genuine or merely suppressed violence. Concludes archist "order" is inherently extracted through institutionalized coercion, placing significant burdens on freedom and ethical consistency.

**The Archist Stability Argument:**

**Core Claim:**
Centralized authority, empowered with special rights (coercion, monopoly on violence), necessary to maintain law, order, stability.

**Empirical Evidence Cited:**
- Historical: Centralized states reducing interpersonal conflict (post-feudal Europe)
- Authoritarian examples: Long-term internal stability (Singapore, Saudi Arabia)
- Failed states: Instability from weak central authority (Somalia, Libya post-2011)

**Underlying Assumptions:**
- Central enforcement reduces interpersonal retaliation and chaos
- Authority resolves coordination and public-goods dilemmas efficiently

**Anarchist Critique:**

**1. Misattribution:**
- What archists call "stability" might actually be repression
- Violence and instability merely suppressed, not resolved
- Order maintained by threat, not genuine peace

**2. Correlation vs Causation:**
- Stability correlates more with rule of law or mutual cooperation
- Rather than authority itself
- Confounding variables not properly isolated

**3. Hidden Violence:**
- Archist stability involves state-sanctioned coercion, imprisonment, threats
- Essentially structural instability disguised as order
- Relocating violence to state monopoly, not eliminating it

**4. Decentralized Stability:**
- Historical examples: Medieval Iceland, historical Celtic Ireland
- Contemporary: Autonomous regions
- Demonstrate voluntary stability possible
- Counter-examples to "chaos without state" narrative

**The Cost of Archist Stability:**

**Economic Cost:**
- Typical liberal democracies: 35-50% total tax burden (explicit + implicit)
- Resembles state-run protection racket
- Citizens pay under threat of severe punishment

**Ethical Cost:**
- Systematic violation of ethical symmetry
- State claims rights above individuals
- Justifies coercion through special status

**Social and Psychological Cost:**
- Normalization of coercion
- Undermines individual autonomy, agency, trust
- Infantilizes population (state as parent)

**Conclusion:**

Archist claim of superior stability = **conditionally valid but ethically problematic**

Stability achieved through:
- Coercion
- Ethical asymmetry
- Enormous economic, social, moral costs

Honest appraisal must acknowledge: "Order" archism promises is inherently extracted through institutionalized coercion, placing significant burdens on individual freedom and ethical consistency.

## Key Concepts

- **Archist stability** – Order maintained through centralized coercion
- **Hidden violence** – State violence disguised as stability
- **Protection racket** – Coerced payment for "protection"
- **Ethical asymmetry cost** – Price of different rules for state vs individuals
- **Suppressed vs resolved** – Violence relocated rather than eliminated
- **Decentralized stability** – Historical examples of voluntary order
- **Rule of law vs authority** – Confounding factors in stability

## Evolution Notes

- Direct engagement with archist (statist) arguments
- Acknowledges empirical observation (states do provide stability) while critiquing costs
- Important for Axiocracy: Must address "chaos without state" objection
- Shows how to grant opponents' empirical points while shifting evaluation criteria
- Economic quantification (35-50%) makes abstract costs concrete
- Distinguishes order (peace) from order (suppressed violence)
- Foundation for anarchist alternative proposals

## Cross-References



## Open Questions

- What level of tax burden would be acceptable if truly voluntary?
- Can decentralized order scale to modern population densities?
- How to measure "hidden violence" of state systems quantitatively?
- What about network effects (stability begets stability)?
- How to transition without chaos period?
- What about external threats (military defense)?
- Can competing protection agencies avoid becoming states themselves?
