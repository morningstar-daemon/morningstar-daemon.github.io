## Summary

Argues **if morality is conditional, so is evil**—but evil doesn't vanish, it gets **clarified**. Rejects objective evil (metaphysical specter, cosmic decree) in favor of **conditional definition: evil = intentional harm to agency** (deliberate reduction of another's capacity to choose, flourish, project into future). **What we lose:** Aura of cosmic decree, unquestionable trump card. **What we gain:** Intellectual honesty, operational definition, testable criterion. Example: Hitler evil not by eternal decree but because actions represent **deliberate annihilation of human agency on mass scale**. Conditional definition is enough. Superstition dies; precision emerges.

## Key Concepts
- **Demystification** – Stripping metaphysical aura while preserving functional concept
- **Conditional evil** – Evil as intentional harm within chosen value framework
- **Agency reduction** – Core criterion for evil under agency protection
- **Operational definition** – Testable without appeal to hidden gods
