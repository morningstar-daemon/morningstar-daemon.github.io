## Summary
This essay responds to a tweet claiming "smart people obsess over truth at the expense of memetic fitness," arguing this captures a real tension but draws dangerous conclusions if taken as prescription. The piece distinguishes two orthogonal dimensions: truth (correspondence with reality) and memetic fitness (replicative spread through social systems). While truth alone doesn't guarantee transmission—ideas must be packaged with emotion, narrative, simplicity—prioritizing fitness over truth yields propaganda and "ideological cancer." The essay critiques the slippery slope from "lies are tools" to becoming what you despise. The constructive kernel: truth needs luminous presentation, not dilution. The solution is "memetic engineering under epistemic constraint"—designing ideas to reproduce without mutating into nonsense by making truth aesthetically contagious, clarity emotionally satisfying, and rigor narratively elegant. Core principle: "Truth is the invariant payload; memetic fitness is the transmission protocol."

## Key Concepts
- **Truth vs. memetic fitness** – Orthogonal dimensions: correspondence with reality vs. replicative success in social systems.
- **Propaganda logic** – Believing truth and survival are incompatible leads to rationalizing deception as necessary evil.
- **Memetic engineering under epistemic constraint** – Designing contagious ideas that preserve truth rather than mutating into falsehood.
- **Transmission protocol metaphor** – Memetic fitness as packaging/delivery system for truth payload, not substitute for it.
- **Luminous truth** – Making signal sharp enough to cut through noise without dilution or deception.
- **Sterile communication vs. ideological cancer** – Twin failures of pure truth-focus (no spread) and pure fitness-focus (corrupt spread).

## Evolution Notes
- Synthesizes Axio's epistemological rigor with pragmatic communication awareness.
- The "memetic engineering" concept connects to broader Axio interest in how ideas propagate and institutions evolve.
- Positions itself between naive truth-worship (rationalist error) and cynical manipulation (propagandist error).
- The Dawkins/Feynman/Pinker exemplars show successful alignment of truth and transmission.
- Extends earlier posts on memetic dynamics, infohazards, and mind viruses into prescriptive communication ethics.
- The invariant payload metaphor echoes information-theoretic framing throughout the archive.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Where is the boundary between legitimate "packaging" of truth and manipulative framing that distorts it?
- Can we empirically measure when memetic optimization crosses into truth-corruption, or is this always a judgment call?
- How do we handle truths that are inherently un-luminous (complex, counterintuitive, emotionally unappealing)—is simplification always falsification?
- What institutional structures incentivize memetic engineering under epistemic constraint versus propaganda?
- Does the framework apply to non-propositional knowledge (skills, intuitions, tacit understanding) or only explicit claims?
- How do we distinguish between truth that failed to spread due to poor packaging versus truth that genuinely deserved to die?
- Is there a tension between accessibility (broad transmission) and precision (accurate transmission) that cannot be fully resolved?
