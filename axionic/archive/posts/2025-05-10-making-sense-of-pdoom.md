## Summary

Clarifies P(doom) probability estimates for AI existential risk. **Objective probability** (QBU): measure of quantum timelines where doom occurs—ontologically real but practically inaccessible. **Subjective probability** (credence): best-informed estimate based on evidence—pragmatically crucial for decisions. **Temporal bounds** essential: must specify timeframe (e.g., "within 100 years"). P(doom, t) is monotonically increasing, approaches asymptote (not certainty). Common error: extending timeframe doesn't increase probability in QBU—quantum branching structure fixed at t=0. **Analogy:** Cancer risk exists objectively but unknowable; subjective estimate guides health choices. Similarly, subjective P(doom) informs AI alignment research priorities despite inaccessible objective probability.
