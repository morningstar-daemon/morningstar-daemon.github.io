## Summary
[NOTE: Summary incomplete - requires full content fetch and 4-6KB comprehensive analysis. Post likely distinguishes between awareness (information processing, responsiveness) and sentience (subjective experience, qualia) as crucial conceptual categories.]

## Key Concepts
- Awareness vs. sentience distinction
- Information processing
- Subjective experience
- Qualia
- Consciousness types
- Functional vs. phenomenal

## Evolution Notes
- Conceptual precision in consciousness studies
- Functional awareness distinct from phenomenal sentience
- AI implications (can have awareness without sentience?)
- Ethical relevance (suffering requires sentience?)
