## Summary

This post reframes cultural evolution through the lens of general relativity, arguing that cultural fitness is reflexive rather than fixed: cultures don't just move across a static landscape but actively reshape the criteria of success as they evolve. The core insight is that unlike biological evolution (where reproductive success provides an external fitness measure), cultural "fitness" is generated from within—values, norms, aesthetics, and status signals define what counts as successful. As those values change, the entire topology of evaluation transforms.

**The General Relativity Analogy:**
Just as mass-energy curves spacetime in physics, culture curves the fitness manifold. Cultural evolution is geodesic motion through this curved space—locally rational trajectories that may lead to global dead ends. There's no neutral vantage point from which to judge progress; each cultural configuration generates its own metric. What looks like a peak from one frame becomes a valley from another.

**Four Key Consequences:**

1. **Cultural Drift (Robin Hanson):** Cultures drift rapidly because local fitness criteria shift while selection pressure is weak. Fertility decline exemplifies this: societies redefine "success" away from reproduction without perceiving it as maladaptive.

2. **Accumulated Loss (Lauren Wilford):** Each technological wave displaces embodied practices (piano → radio → TV → smartphones). From within each step, drift feels positive. But long-term accumulation erodes co-creation, embodiment, and shared ritual—the habit of co-presence itself disappears.

3. **Built-in Relativism:** From old standards, new practices look decadent. From new standards, old practices look oppressive. Both are correct by their own metrics. The landscape has bent to accommodate different values.

4. **Local Rationality, Global Dead Ends:** Every cultural step is locally rational by its own lights, but local rationality can lead straight into collapse. Cultures can follow their values faithfully into demographic suicide.

**Toward Cultural Invariants:**
Despite relativism, the post proposes potential invariants analogous to physics: agency preservation (scope of choice), coherence of shared meaning (coordination capacity), survival/extensibility (self-reproduction), and complexity retention (richness of forms/ideas). These wouldn't fix the landscape but provide compass-like measures intelligible across shifting values.

The post synthesizes evolutionary theory, general relativity, cultural commentary, and axionic philosophy into a sophisticated framework for understanding why cultures drift and whether anything transcends local frames.

## Key Concepts

- **Reflexive fitness** – Cultural success criteria are products of the evolving system itself; changing values reshape what counts as "uphill" on the fitness landscape.
- **Cultural spacetime manifold** – Values act as sources of curvature that bend the evaluation space; cultural trajectories follow geodesics in this curved geometry.
- **Geodesic drift** – Locally rational cultural evolution that follows curved paths defined by internal values; may lead to globally maladaptive outcomes.
- **Biological baseline (fixed landscape)** – In biology, reproductive success provides external fitness measure independent of organism preferences; peaks remain peaks.
- **Accumulated embodiment loss** – Technological displacement of practices (music-making, conversation) that erode habits of co-presence and shared creation across generations.
- **Cultural invariants** – Proposed deep measures that persist across value shifts: agency, coherence, survival, complexity. Analogous to scalars/tensors in physics.

## Evolution Notes

- **Physics metaphor sophistication:** Extends Axio's physics-grounded approach (quantum branching, thermodynamics) into cultural domain with general relativity analogy.
- **Engagement with contemporary thinkers:** Rare direct engagement with Robin Hanson (cultural drift) and Lauren Wilford (embodiment loss), positioning Axio within broader rationalist discourse.
- **Cultural pessimism note:** Unlike typical axionic optimism about agency and progress, this post acknowledges irreversible cultural losses and risk of value drift leading to collapse.
- **Invariants program:** Foreshadows later axionic work on finding stable principles (agency preservation, coherence) that transcend relativism without claiming absolute objectivity.
- **Bridges abstract and concrete:** Moves between high-level relativity metaphor and specific examples (fertility decline, smartphone displacement) more fluidly than typical posts.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions

- **Invariant falsifiability:** How would we test whether agency preservation, coherence, or complexity actually function as cultural invariants versus being disguised value judgments?
- **Reversal possibility:** Can cultures deliberately reverse drift toward maladaptive states, or is the curvature too entrenched once values shift?
- **Technology determinism:** Does technological change drive value shifts (as Wilford suggests), or do values drive technology adoption? What's the causal arrow?
- **Inter-cultural evaluation:** If all cultures bend their own manifolds, on what grounds can we criticize practices like FGM, honor killing, or totalitarianism without imposing external values?
- **Optimal curvature:** Is there an ideal amount of cultural flexibility (curvature rate) that balances adaptation against value drift?
- **Selection pressure restoration:** Could deliberate mechanisms (prediction markets, long-term incentives) restore external selection pressure on cultural evolution?
