## Summary

Short post connecting **indexical uncertainty** (Yudkowsky) with **timeline uncertainty**. Yudkowsky: "Only true randomness/irreducible uncertainty = standing in multiple places, unable to tell who you are (indexical uncertainty)." **Connection:** In QBU, indexical uncertainty = timeline uncertainty—uncertainty about which branch you're on. **Two framings, same phenomenon:** (1) "Who am I / which location?" (indexical), (2) "Which timeline am I on?" (QBU). Examples: Sleeping Beauty, Schrödinger's cat, simulation hypotheses. **Implication:** Quantum randomness = self-location uncertainty across branches, not ontological indeterminacy. Enhances quantum decision theory interpretation. Brief but conceptually important bridge between rationalist discourse (LessWrong) and QBU framework.
