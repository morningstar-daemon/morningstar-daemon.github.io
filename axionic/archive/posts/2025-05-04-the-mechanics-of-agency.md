## Summary

Defines genuine agency through three essential criteria: **(1) Embeddedness** (existing within/interacting with environment, boundary conditions, continuous information/energy exchange), **(2) Predictive Modeling** (internal representations, simulation/forecasting, outcome evaluation), **(3) Intentional Biasing** (preferences/goals, influencing outcomes toward preferred states, non-random goal-directed behavior). Distinguishes genuine agents from purely reactive/mechanical systems. Identifies Minimal Viable Agent (MVA): simplest system fulfilling criteria—minimal reinforcement learning agents emerge as promising candidates. Explores biological agency: single-celled organisms satisfy criteria through chemotaxis, habituation, goal-directed resource seeking.

**Key Insight:** Genuine agency goes beyond stimulus-response, exhibits internally driven goal-directed behavior, modifies actions based on anticipated (not just current) states.
