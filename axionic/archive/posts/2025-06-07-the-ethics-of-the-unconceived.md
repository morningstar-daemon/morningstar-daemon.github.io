# [The Ethics of the Unconceived](https://axionic.org/posts/165387299.the-ethics-of-the-unconceived.html)

## Summary

Defends embryo selection against "murder" accusations. Argues reproductive choice always involves selecting among possible futures; technology just makes it explicit.

**Key Concepts:**

**Selection vs Annihilation:**
- Choosing one embryo over another ≠ killing a person
- Potential lives vastly outnumber actual ones
- Every reproductive decision forecloses countless possible people
- **Core error:** Confusing virtual with actual, imagined with instantiated
- Possibility ≠ personhood

**Absurd Implications of "Murder" Framing:**
If not actualizing potential life = murder, then so is:
- Abstaining from sex
- Choosing different partner
- Waiting a week to conceive

**Making Implicit Explicit:**
- What changed: not nature of choice, but clarity
- Decisions once vague/passive become structured/informed
- Ethical discomfort from seeing how choices are made, not from choices themselves

**No Moral Neutrality:**
- Not choosing is still a choice
- Ignorance doesn't absolve consequences
- Declining to use knowledge = refusal of responsibility
- Not eugenics, not coercion—individual agency informed by science

**QBU Perspective:**
- All physically possible outcomes occur somewhere
- Choosing one path doesn't annihilate others—locates you within particular branch
- Others continue, just not from your perspective
- Moral significance: not who you exclude, but which future you take responsibility for
- **Agency in QBU:** Not power to erase, but responsibility to steer
