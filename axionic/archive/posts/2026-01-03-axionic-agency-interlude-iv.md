## Summary
Interlude marking progress checkpoint in Axionic Agency sequence. Provides overview of completed work (I-VI.6), relationships between pieces, and what remains unresolved. Clarifies that sequence is not building toward single culminating result but establishing family of related constraints on coherent agency architecture. Reviews kernel integrity (AKI), causal verification (MCI/ACV/anchored), stasis regime discovery, and authority lease response. Makes explicit: Axio is not alignment solution but constraint-discovery project—identifying what can and cannot coexist in reflective agency under adversarial pressure. Discusses methodological choices: why prototypes over proofs, why falsifiability over persuasion, why implemented boundaries over philosophical argumentation. Sets expectations for remaining work: no grand unified theory forthcoming, only continued mapping of structural limits and viable architectures within them.

## Key Concepts
- **Family of constraints** – Not unified theory but related boundaries on coherent agency
- **Constraint-discovery project** – Mapping structural limits not solving alignment
- **Falsifiability over persuasion** – Prototypes demonstrate what can/cannot be enforced
- **Stasis as discovery** – Unexpected result reshaping subsequent approach
- **Methodological transparency** – Making choices explicit: implementation over argumentation

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- What remaining kernel invariants need implementation/testing?
- How do constraint families compose—can all be satisfied simultaneously?
- At what point does constraint-discovery become complete enough for deployment?
