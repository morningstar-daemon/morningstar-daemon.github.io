## Summary
This essay responds to the critique that libertarianism "can't handle evil" by clarifying what legal/political frameworks can plausibly do while preserving agency. Evil is defined as intentional harm caused by an agent—knowingly acting to reduce another's feasible futures. Evil arises upstream of law (from preference structures, beliefs, incentives, commitments agents form); law can respond to harmful actions but cannot reach into intention without extending coercion into thought. Eliminating evil requires preemptive force, which itself harms by restricting agency before demonstrated harm—structural limit. The work shifts to culture: norms, reputation, selective association, covenant communities, exit—mechanisms that constrain behavior without coercion, failures remain local not systemic. Defensive action becomes legitimate once harm/credible threat exists; containment justified by demonstrated patterns, not inferred intent. The "something else" supplement historically becomes moral authority acting ahead of harm, expanding into routine administration. Agency-centered framework accepts risk in exchange for authorship; alternative replaces authorship with managed behavior. The choice: authorship with risk vs. safety without authorship.

## Key Concepts
- **Evil as intentional harm** – Agent knowingly acting to reduce another's feasible future options; arises upstream of law from internal agent structures (preferences, beliefs, incentives).
- **Structural limit of law** – Eliminating evil requires preemptive force; preemption restricts agency before demonstrated harm (itself counts as harm); cannot reach intention without thought-coercion.
- **Moral preemption failure mode** – Systems claiming power to eradicate evil either redefine evil as disobedience or authorize action on suspicion/prediction; responsibility shifts from agents to institutions, harm becomes procedural.
- **Culture as containment layer** – When law withdraws from moral preemption, culture performs indispensable work: norms, reputation, selective association, shunning/exclusion, covenant communities, exit. Mechanisms constrain without coercion; failures local not systemic.
- **Cultural robustness as requirement** – Libertarian legal minimalism functionally presupposes strong culture; weak culture + restrained law = predation fills gap; strong culture + restrained law = agency remains viable.
- **Defensive action legitimacy** – Proportional force, containment, isolation legitimate once harm/credible threat exists; incarceration as defensive isolation (not punishment/deterrence/correction); justified while threat persists based on patterns, not intent.
- **Authority expansion pattern** – Moral authority justified by necessity tends to expand; values become enforceable, beliefs become risks, control presents as care; promise of moral safety conceals authorship transfer from individuals to systems.
- **Agency-preserving sufficiency** – No alternative reduces intentional harm while preserving agency more effectively; stronger guarantees require deeper coercion, increasing net harm by collapsing authorship/evaluability.

## Evolution Notes
- Bridges political philosophy (libertarianism) with Axionic agency framework—shows how structural constraints inform political arrangements.
- The "evil arises upstream of law" framing clarifies the limitation as structural rather than ideological inadequacy.
- Culture recast as functional requirement rather than optional nicety—critical infrastructure in agency-preserving systems.
- The preemption/prediction failure mode explains why "just stop bad people before they act" doesn't work without collapsing into authoritarianism.
- Positions libertarianism not as "can't handle evil" but as "refuses to handle it in ways that destroy agency"—reframes weakness as principled boundary.
- Sets up broader critique of prevention-based governance visible in "Against Leviathan."

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- What's the threshold of cultural strength needed for libertarian legal minimalism to remain viable—can it be measured?
- If culture fails locally, when (if ever) is escalation to legal coercion justified without violating agency-preserving principles?
- How does this framework handle systematic cultural failures (e.g., widespread radicalization, collapse of norms)—does it admit any preemptive intervention?
- Can defensive containment be distinguished reliably from punishment in practice, or do they inevitably blur?
- What mechanisms could strengthen culture without becoming authoritarian—or is cultural robustness inherently fragile/emergent?
- Does the framework apply cross-culturally, or does it presuppose specific Western liberal norms?
- If "authorship with risk" is chosen, who bears the costs—those harmed by unpreventable evil, or society broadly?
