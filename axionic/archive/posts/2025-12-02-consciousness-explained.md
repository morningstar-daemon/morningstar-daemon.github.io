## Summary
This post presents the Modeler-Schema Theory of Consciousness, a mechanistic account that identifies a specific computational locus of experience within a multi-agent cognitive architecture. The theory proposes that consciousness resides in the "Modeler-schema" component, which generates qualia as an internal calibration mechanism for detecting inconsistencies in the World Model. Critically, the theory offers a falsifiable experimental prediction about change detection during saccades, moving consciousness research from metaphysical speculation to testable science. The framework resolves the "hard problem" by treating phenomenal experience as a necessary comparator function rather than an inexplicable add-on.

## Key Concepts
- **Modeler-schema** – The specific cybernetic component that generates qualia and experiences consciousness, distinct from the Controller (narrator) and Targeter (attention).
- **Quale World Model** – The internal representation constructed by the Modeler-schema using qualia as the comparison medium for detecting modeling errors.
- **Architectural decoupling** – The separation between the experiencing agent (Modeler-schema) and narrating agent (Controller), explaining why introspective reports don't match actual phenomenology.
- **Diffuse awareness** – Panoramic, continuous consciousness that exists in the Modeler-schema but is inaccessible to the Controller's reporting mechanisms.
- **Qualia as calibration** – Phenomenal experience serves as an internal representational format optimized for detecting mismatches across perception, memory, and abstraction.

## Evolution Notes
- Aligns with Axio's agency-first approach by treating experience as a functional operation in a control architecture, not emergent magic.
- Provides concrete mechanistic grounding for consciousness that most theories avoid.
- Offers rare falsifiable prediction: permanent vs. temporary changes during saccades should show different detection patterns.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- How would this architecture be implemented in artificial systems to generate genuine experience?
- Can the saccade experiment definitively distinguish this theory from competing calibration accounts?
- What evolutionary pressures shaped the specific qualia representations we experience rather than others?
