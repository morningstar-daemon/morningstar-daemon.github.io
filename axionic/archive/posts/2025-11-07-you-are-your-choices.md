## Summary

Core identity and agency post. In QBU, self isn't stable essence that makes decisions—it's conditional boundary defined BY decisions. Universal wavefunction evolves unitarily, branching into all physically possible continuations. Self doesn't inhabit all measure M; inhabits partition of it—subset where internal computation/memory/intentions remain coherent. Each choice redefines that partition. You don't move universe; you locate yourself within it. To say "you are your choices" = physical description, not moral rhetoric. Choice is conditionalization (self-locating update in measure space), not causation. Identity = continuity of correlation. To choose well = preserve coherence. Freedom = conditional localization within invariant totality. Self = iterative narrowing, boundary that choices continuously redraw.

## Core Physics

**1. The Physics of Identity:**
Self ≠ subject standing apart from world. Self = conditional boundary defined by decisions.

In QBU:
- Universal wavefunction evolves unitarily, branching continuously
- Nothing eliminated; every possible outcome occurs somewhere within total measure M
- Self doesn't inhabit all M—inhabits partition (subset where internal computation/memory/intentions coherent)
- Each choice redefines that partition
- You don't move universe; you locate yourself within it
- Map of "you" redrawn with every deliberation

"To say you are your choices is therefore not moral rhetoric, but physical description. You are the evolving conditional structure that your choices carve into reality."

**2. Fixed Measure, Moving Boundaries:**
Total measure invariant. You cannot increase/decrease M—no agent can. Choices alter not amount of measure but mapping between internal computation and global measure landscape.

Formally, if μ = global measure, S_t = cognitive state at time t:
Y_t = {w ∈ M | w consistent with S_t}

When you choose, you don't shift μ; you redefine Y_t. Partition of measure counting as you changes.

"Choice is therefore conditionalization, not causation—a self-locating update in the measure space. The world does not bend to will; the will defines its coordinate system."

**3. Coherence as Continuity:**
Identity = not sameness of substance but continuity of correlation. Remain same person only insofar as cognitive process maintains coherence between past/future partitions of measure.

Every decision narrows coherence to more specific subset—ones where algorithm continued in same general direction. Each choice = act of self-definition. "You" after decision = new correlation pattern, more tightly constrained.

To choose well = preserve coherence (high internal consistency, predictive accuracy, value alignment)
To choose poorly = disperse yourself into incoherence, scatter amplitude across incompatible futures

**4. Measure Responsibility:**
If all possible choices occur somewhere, moral responsibility cannot be about preventing outcomes. Must be about where your continuity lies.

Measure responsibility replaces moral desert. Act ethically = maximize measure of worlds where values realized, minimize those where harm propagates.

Cannot delete bad branches, but can decline to inhabit them. Obligation: ensure majority of amplitude flows through futures worth existing in.

"Goodness is coherence: preservation of integrity across branching timelines. Evil is decoherence: loss of alignment between intention and continuation."

**5. Freedom as Conditional Localization:**
Traditional compatibilism: freedom = acting according to desires within deterministic law
In QBU: becomes literal physics—agent's internal dynamics constrain conditional amplitude distributions
Freedom = self-locating autonomy within law

"Your agency does not override determinism; it inhabits it."

Determinism and free will not opposites—orthogonal descriptions of same structure (global wavefunction evolution vs local filtering of identity).

"Freedom is not about causing different worlds to exist. It is about determining which subset of existing worlds continues to include you."

**6. The Recursive Self:**
Self as iterative narrowing:
Y_0 = initial partition of measure consistent with birth
C_1 = first choice → Y_1 = Y_0 filtered by C_1
...
Y_t+1 = Y_t ∩ {w | w consistent with C_{t+1}}

Each new choice further constrains set of branches consistent with existence. Over time, intersection defines life trajectory—measure-weighted region where pattern persists.

"You are not a thing that makes choices. You are the boundary that choices continuously redraw."

**7. The Measure of the Self:**
Every choice narrows uncertainty by establishing new conditional correlations between self and world. Narrowing not loss—identity crystallization. You after decision = smaller in potential but greater in definition.

"Freedom, then, is not about unlimited possibility but about deliberate self-contraction—the willed collapse of ambiguity into coherence. It is through choosing that you become someone definite."

## Final Aphorism

"You are your choices.
Not metaphorically, but physically.
The self is the coherence pattern forged by choice—
not what remains after possibility, but what organizes it."

## Relation to Axio Framework

Central pillar connecting:
- **QBU:** branching structure, measure, Pattern Identifiers
- **Physics of Agency:** control as amplitude steering
- **Coherence:** identity as correlated pattern
- **Measure vs Credence:** objective (M) vs subjective (self-location)
- **Freedom:** compatibilist resolution via conditional localization
- **Ethics:** responsibility as measure-weighted consequences
- **Logical Identity:** pattern persistence across reinstantiations
