## Summary

Analyzes sentences that fail to be truth-evaluable not because they're moral/preferential but because they're underdetermined—lacking context or reference needed for evaluation. Categories: indexical gap (where/when unspecified), referential void (failed reference), quantifier abyss (unstated domain), conditional mirage (hidden antecedent), standardless evaluation (undefined metric), category violation (predicate can't apply to subject). In Conditionalism, truth arises only once relevant conditions are bound. Binding transforms language from gesture to knowledge. Every meaningful claim presupposes background conditions—meaning exists only when coordinates are fixed.

## Seven Categories of Underdetermination

**1. Indexical Gap:**
"It's raining" neither true nor false without where/when. Once bound ("Montreal at 9am") becomes truth-evaluable. Indexicals (here, now, today, she, they) = invisible placeholders for context.

**2. Referential Void:**
"Present King of France is bald" (Russell). No entity satisfies subject term. Syntactically valid, semantically empty. Failure = ontological absence, not preference/probability.

**3. Quantifier Abyss:**
"Everyone is online" or "Nothing is certain" depend on unstated quantifier domain. Everyone where? Certainty about what? Until quantifier bound to scope, truth value floats.

**4. Conditional Mirage:**
"She would have succeeded" or "That would be impossible" presuppose unstated condition. Masquerade as declaratives while hiding invisible antecedent. Missing clause (if funding had arrived, under current laws) = difference between emptiness and testable counterfactual.

**5. Standardless Evaluation:**
"The system is secure," "This is fair," "That's efficient" collapse for lack of defined metric. Without specifying threat model, ethical standard, optimization criterion, cannot be falsified. Not opinions—evaluations awaiting standard.

**6. Category Violation:**
"The color green is angry" or "Truth is heavy" fail by category error. Predicate cannot logically apply to subject. Syntactically well-formed, semantically void.

**7. Binding as Resolution:**
"In Conditionalism, truth arises only once the relevant conditions are bound. Agent-binding handles moral claims; condition-binding generalizes the principle."

When hidden variables (context, reference, scope, standard) made explicit, statement transitions from pseudo-propositional noise into empirical/logical claim.

## The Conditionalist Diagnosis

"Underdetermined statements reveal why unconditional truth is impossible. Every meaningful claim presupposes background conditions: a vantage, a referent, a time, a standard, a model of the world."

"Each unbound statement is a potential mapping from syntax to world—an as-yet undefined correspondence awaiting the specification of its coordinates. Meaning exists only when those coordinates are fixed."

"Truth is not an inherent property of sentences but a relation between a statement and the conditions that make it interpretable."

## Relation to Axio Framework

Core Conditionalism post establishing:
- Truth as conditional on interpretation
- Meaning requires binding to coordinates
- Multiple categories of semantic failure
- Resolution through explicit condition specification

Connects to:
- **Truth Machines:** computation as interpretation
- **Conditionalism:** truth relative to framework
- **QBU:** measurement as binding event
- **Agent-relative truth:** moral claims requiring agent-binding
