## Summary

Illustrates agency principles using Matching Pennies game. Two agents simultaneously choose heads/tails: Matcher wins if both match, Mismatcher wins if different.

**Agency Elements:**
- **Embeddedness:** Agents continuously interact, dynamically adjusting strategies
- **Predictive Modeling:** Forecast opponent choices using internal representations
- **Intentional Biasing:** Deliberately choose moves to skew outcomes toward preferred states

**Building Predictive Models:**
1. Observation/data collection (recording historical choices)
2. Pattern recognition (identifying statistical trends/biases)
3. Probabilistic forecasting (creating probability distributions)
4. Counterfactual simulation (evaluating potential outcomes)
5. Decision-making/adjustment (maximizing expected outcomes, refining model)

**Key Insights:**
- Optimal play involves mixed strategies (maintaining unpredictability)
- Predictive accuracy correlates with strategic advantage
- Against true randomness: modeling provides no advantage—optimal strategy = pure randomization
- Against environment: behavior follows structured probabilistic rules, modeling becomes feasible

**QBU Connection:** Each decision = branching point generating multiple futures. Agency involves not only predicting but actively shaping probabilities across possible timelines.
