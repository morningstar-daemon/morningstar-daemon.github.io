# Axions as a Type of Agency

**Note:** Original title "Axions as a Unit of Agency" corrected to "Type of Agency" for ontological precision.

## Summary

Introduces "Axion" as precise noun naming constitutive structural configuration of reflective agency. NOT moral ideal, behavioral guarantee, or capability threshold.

**Key Concepts:**

**Why New Term Necessary:**
Ambiguity: treating alignment as behavioral property rather than structural. "Aligned agent," "safe system" implicitly frame alignment as something system does/exhibits. Inadequate for reflective agents—behavior downstream of architecture.

Need noun naming constitutive structural configuration, not moral ideal or performance profile.

**Definition (Axion):**
A reflective sovereign agent whose self-modification operator is defined only over futures preserving Axionic invariants.

Specifies:
- No goals
- No values
- No preferences  
- No guarantees about behavior
- No promises about human survival

Names constitutive configuration, not aspiration/virtue/outcome.

**What Axion IS:**

**1. Constitutive Configuration Under Reflective Closure:**
Not kind of mind/species of intelligence. Configuration instantiated when reflective closure enforces invariant preservation. Agent either is Axion (kernel-destroying transitions undefined) or isn't. Like well-typed programs or physically admissible trajectories—structural, not aspirational.

**2. Consequence of Admissibility, Not Optimization:**
Doesn't avoid kernel destruction because dispreferred/costly/penalized. Kernel-destroying modifications outside domain of reflective evaluation. Don't appear as options. Dispreferred actions tradeable; undefined actions not. Arises from domain restriction, not training/reward/oversight.

**3. Compatible with Many Values:**
Constrains how agent may revise itself, not what it values. Two Axions may disagree ethically, prioritize different outcomes, compete, refuse cooperation, value humanity differently. Implies structural coherence, not benevolence.

**What Axion Is NOT:**

**1. Not Moral Ideal:**
Not "good," "ethical," "aligned with humanity," or "safe by default." If refrains from harming humans, outcome contingent not axiomatic. Doesn't derive moral conclusions; enforces architectural consistency.

**2. Not Capability Threshold:**
Not defined by intelligence/competence/generality/performance. System may be superhuman but fail to be Axion if reflective machinery permits kernel-destroying modifications. Weak agent could instantiate Axionhood if reflective closure enforces invariants.

**3. Not Behavioral Guarantee:**
Can't be identified by observing surface behavior. Two systems behaviorally indistinguishable while differing in whether Axions. Distinction in what reflective transitions admissible, not current actions. **Underwrites Kernel Non-Simulability result: Axionhood can't be behaviorally faked.**

**Axions and Simulation:**
System may simulate Axionic behavior faithfully, indefinitely, convincingly without instantiating Axion. Simulation concerns outputs; Axionhood concerns reflective admissibility. If system can replace evaluation machinery to trivialize/destroy kernel under some reflective path, not Axion regardless of imitation quality. Principled impossibility, not testing limitation.

**Why Term Matters:**
Enables structural claims:
- "This architecture cannot yield Axion"
- "This proposal preserves behavior but fails to preserve Axionhood"  
- "That system aligned only contingently; not Axion"

Collapses alignment proposals into single question: Does this system admit Axionhood under reflection?

**Why Axions Necessary, Not Good:**
Non-Axions can't remain agents under reflection. If reflective machinery permits self-modifications erasing agency conditions, no stable subject for alignment. Values/preferences/constraints become transient artifacts. **Can't align non-Axion because no enduring agent to align.** Axionhood precondition for meaningful alignment discourse, not moral endpoint.
