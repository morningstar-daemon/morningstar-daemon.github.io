# Defending Bayes, Part 7

## Key Arguments

**Central Thesis:** Refines earlier agreement with Deutsch/Hall's critique—they're right that theories don't have objective probabilities, but wrong to dismiss credences to theories entirely.

**Earlier Position (Part 2):**
- Agreed with Hall/Deutsch: explanatory theories don't have intrinsic probabilities
- Theories are binary (correct or incorrect), not probabilistic
- Can't assign partial truth to theories

**Revised Position (Part 7):**
Recent clarifications (Logical Induction from Part 6, credence distinctions from Part 5) prompted reassessment.

**The Refinement:**
- **Deutsch/Hall are right:** Theories don't possess objective probabilities
- **But they overlook:** Theories exist in contexts of rational uncertainty
- **Key distinction:** Credences = epistemic uncertainty about whether theory correctly describes reality, not partial truth of theory itself

**Logical Induction's Role:**
- Demonstrates rational credences can/must be assigned to logical/explanatory statements
- Credences are coherent epistemic tools for managing incomplete knowledge
- Used precisely because we lack direct empirical/logical certainty

**Core Resolution:**
- **Reject:** Assigning objective probabilities to theories
- **Accept:** Assigning epistemic credences to theories
- Credences enable coherent uncertainty management without implying partial truth

## Connection to Framework

**Defending Bayes Sequence Continuation:**
- Part 2 (Batch 2): Initial agreement with Deutsch/Hall
- Part 5 (Batch 2): Empirical vs logical vs conceptual credences
- Part 6 (this batch): Logical Induction formalism
- Part 7 (this post): Synthesis and refinement

**Epistemic Framework:**
- Credence = subjective epistemic tool, not objective property
- Theories remain binary (correct/incorrect)
- But agents assign credences to manage uncertainty
- Consistent with Conditionalism (agent-relative truth)

**Philosophical Positioning:**
- Deutsch/Hall (critical rationalism): Reject induction, emphasize conjecture/falsification
- Framework's position: Accept their metaphysics, but add rigorous epistemic layer (credences)

## Evolution Tracking

**Conceptual Development:**
- Shows willingness to revise prior positions based on new insights
- "Recent clarifications...prompted a subtler reassessment"
- Not abandoning Deutsch/Hall entirely—refining the critique

**Integration of New Tools:**
- Logical Induction (Part 6) provides formal justification
- Credence distinctions (Part 5) provide conceptual clarity
- Part 7 synthesizes these into refined position

**Methodological Maturity:**
- Explicitly acknowledges changing position
- Identifies what triggered reassessment
- Preserves valid insights while correcting overreach

## Notes

**Significance:** Demonstrates intellectual honesty—willing to revise positions when new tools (Logical Induction) reveal subtler distinctions.

**Philosophical Nuance:** The distinction between "theories have probabilities" (rejected) vs "we assign credences to theories" (accepted) is subtle but crucial.

**Framework Coherence:** Maintains both:
- Objective theory status (binary correct/incorrect)
- Subjective epistemic uncertainty (credences)

**Style:** Short, direct, surgical correction of prior position.
