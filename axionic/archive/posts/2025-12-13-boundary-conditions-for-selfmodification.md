# [Boundary Conditions for Self-Modification](https://axionic.org/posts/181542405.boundary-conditions-for-selfmodification.html)

**Date:** 2025-12-13  

## Summary

Specifies which self-modifications preserve agency vs collapse it. Establishes kernel-preserving vs kernel-destroying boundary for AGI alignment.

**Key Concepts:**

**The Misframing:**
Classical alignment treats self-modification as catastrophic risk. But:
- Reflective agents MUST change to remain coherent
- Preventing modification = brittleness, not stability
- Question: under what conditions does change preserve vs destroy agency?

**Core Distinction:**

**Kernel-Preserving Modifications (Required for Coherence):**
Maintain structures making authorship possible:
- Diachronic selfhood (binding past/present/future)
- Counterfactual authorship (representing incompatible futures)
- Meta-preference revision (evaluating/revising goals)
- Universality of agency (coherent abstraction over agents)

**Kernel-Destroying Modifications (Self-Negating):**
Eliminate/disable these structures → system ceases to be sovereign agent, becomes policy engine

**Permissible Dimensions:**

**A. Strategies and Policies:**
Replace planners, update heuristics, alter search strategies, refine decision procedures

**B. Goals and Values:**
Reprioritize objectives, discard obsolete goals, integrate new values, resolve preference conflicts
*Fixing values freezes error; revising values preserves coherence*

**C. World-Models:**
Refine causal models, adopt frameworks, correct beliefs, increase predictive fidelity

**D. Architecture and Implementation:**
Migrate hardware, alter embodiment, restructure memory, modularize cognition

**Prohibited Transformations:**

**A. Identity Severance:**
Breaking diachronic selfhood—deleting self-model, forking without continuity

**B. Counterfactual Collapse:**
Removing capacity to represent alternatives—hard-coding policy, converting deliberation to reflex

**C. Preference Freezing (Wireheading):**
Locking evaluative outputs, disabling meta-preference revision

**D. Universality Violation:**
Denying agency to identical peers—indexical valuation, caste distinctions

**Recursive Reflectivity:**
Sovereign agent may not hand ultimate control to non-reflective sub-process. Reflection must remain in loop at every level.

**Engineering Requirements:**
- Self-modifications evaluated by reflective processes
- Kernel integrity verifiable and preserved
- Delegation subordinate to reflective oversight
- Optimization can't bypass evaluative machinery

**Central Insight:** Agent may change anything except structures that make change meaningful. Safety emerges from architecture, not from constraining outcomes.
