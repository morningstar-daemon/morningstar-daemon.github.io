## Summary
This post analyzes how incentive misalignment produces systemic pathologies when strategies that win lower-level games degrade coherence at higher levels. Axios defines misalignment formally: "when actions that optimize performance at level L degrade coherence, stability, or persistence at level L+1." The piece identifies five major forms: local vs. global (departments optimize publication counts, replication collapses), short vs. long-term (dense immediate feedback dominates sparse future benefits), signaling vs. substance (appearance eclipses reality), coalition vs. truth (alliance-securing beliefs defeat reality-tracking), and survival vs. stated-purpose (institutional self-preservation supersedes mission). These misalignments propagate through cascades (downward/upward), lock-ins (anti-corrective systems), and runaway dynamics (metrics become meaningless targets). The ultimate framing: misaligned systems are patterns losing the persistence game by burning coherence for short-term advantage.

## Key Concepts
- **Incentive misalignment** – When strategies optimizing lower-level performance degrade higher-level coherence/stability/persistence; structural consequence, not moral failure.
- **Five forms** – Local/global, short/long-term, signaling/substance, coalition/truth, survival/stated-purpose misalignments.
- **Cascade dynamics** – Small high-level misalignments reshape all lower levels (funding→journals→scientists→replication); local distortions destabilize higher systems.
- **Lock-in effects** – Entrenched pathological incentives resist reform; system becomes anti-corrective as exploiters outcompete reformers.
- **Runaway dynamics** – Self-amplifying misalignments (Goodhart's Law: metrics become targets become meaningless).
- **Persistence tension** – All misalignment reflects conflict between local optimization and long-term pattern coherence.

## Evolution Notes
- Synthesizes metagame framework (posts 81, 84, 87) with pattern theory (post 90) to diagnose systemic dysfunction.
- The five-form taxonomy provides operational diagnostic framework applicable across domains.
- Positions agency as capacity to resist misaligned incentive capture and redesign environments.
- Connects abstract game theory to concrete institutional pathologies (academia, corporations, politics, media).

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can institutions design incentive structures that genuinely resist misalignment drift, or is this structurally impossible?
- What distinguishes "misalignment" from legitimate trade-offs between competing legitimate goals?
- Do the diagnostic questions (who benefits, what would change) provide actionable interventions or just better hindsight?
- Can understanding misalignment dynamics prevent capture by pathological incentives, or does that understanding itself get weaponized?
