## Summary

Intellectual ecosystems require diversity of dissent. Monoculture consensus vulnerable to blind spots and egregore capture. Contrarians serve ecological function: stress-testing assumptions, exploring neglected possibilities, preventing premature convergence. Not all dissent is valuable (some is noise), but systematic exclusion of contrarians weakens collective epistemics. Healthy discourse balances consensus-building with productive disagreement.

## Key Concepts

- **Epistemic diversity** – Variety of viewpoints as cognitive immune system
- **Contrarian function** – Stress-testing consensus, exploring alternatives
- **Monoculture vulnerability** – Uniform agreement creates blind spots
