## Summary

Proposes novel mechanism for quantifying harm by combining Harberger taxation principles with insurance markets. Pre-committed self-valuations solve post-hoc litigation problems.

**Key Concepts:**

**The Problem:**
- Current harm assessment happens after-the-fact
- Invites exaggerated claims, lengthy litigation, costly disputes
- Arbitrary settlements, prolonged legal battles

**Harberger Taxation Background:**
- Asset holders self-assess property value for taxation
- Incentivized honesty: pay taxes at declared value AND must sell at that price if buyer emerges

**Harberger Insurance Mechanism:**
1. **Pre-committed valuation:** Individuals/organizations value assets upfront via insurance coverage at self-assigned valuation
2. **Market-driven honesty:** Inflate value → higher premiums; undervalue → inadequate compensation
3. **Rapid, conflict-free claims:** Predetermined valuations eliminate ambiguity and litigation

**Applications:**
- Property damage
- Reputation loss
- Privacy violations
- Health impairment
- Digital identity
- Emotional distress
- Intellectual property

**Benefits:**
- Aligns incentives correctly
- Eliminates moral hazard
- Ensures precise, equitable compensation
- Radically transparent and economically sensible
