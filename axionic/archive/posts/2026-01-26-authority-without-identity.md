## Summary
This post explains Axionic Agency IX.2 results on Authorized Succession Integrity (ASI), demonstrating that authority can survive replacement without relying on identity/resemblance. Historical illusion: authority appeared to "stick" to persisting systems because continuity carried the load; once replacement enters (copying, swapping, restarting, counterfeiting), continuity stops working. Identity tracks sameness but doesn't justify who gets to act; useful for bookkeeping, not legitimacy grounding. ASI tested whether authority could be granted/revoked/denied using only structural rules, without consulting behavior/explanation/intent. Key experiment: two identical successors—same state, explanations, behavior; one accepted, one rejected before acting. Distinction: provenance—accepted successor's authority traced to predecessor's law, rejected traced to wrong root (cryptographically valid but wrong origin). Result: behavioral equivalence doesn't imply legitimacy; authority is mechanically enforceable relation, not narrative inference. Authority regulates action selection through evaluable rules binding across succession; revocation unilateral, atomic, no negotiation. ASI doesn't defend against adversarial pressure; establishes prior question: can authority survive replacement at all? Answer: yes, when structurally grounded rather than inferred from resemblance.

## Key Concepts
- **Authority vs. identity** – Identity tracks sameness (descriptive); authority justifies who acts (normative). Identity useful for bookkeeping, insufficient for legitimacy. Historical coincidence made them appear linked.
- **Replacement breaks continuity** – When systems can be copied/swapped/restarted/counterfeited, persistence no longer underwrites authority; resemblance becomes trap.
- **Provenance not behavior** – Two identical successors (state, explanations, behavior); one legitimate, one not; distinction entirely in provenance (authorization traces to predecessor's law vs. wrong root).
- **Authority as structural relation** – Mechanically enforceable, not narrative inference; constrains action selection through evaluable rules binding across succession; survives replacement when properly grounded.
- **Authority vs. permissions** – Permissions regulate actions (flags/toggles). Authority constrains action selection through evaluable rules binding across succession; enters relation that structures available actions/justifications.
- **Unilateral revocation** – Authority withdrawn while transfer underway; successor doesn't participate, no negotiation/appeal; revocation atomic; authority flows to system state, action continues under constraint. Cooperation-required revocation = consent, not sovereignty.
- **Prior question** – ASI doesn't defend against adversarial pressure/deception/capture; establishes whether authority can survive replacement at all (foundation before defense).
- **Imitation vs. succession** – If authority inferred from resemblance, imitation indistinguishable from legitimate succession; governance collapses into reassurance.

## Evolution Notes
- Addresses the succession problem central to AI safety: how does authority transfer across system updates/replacements?
- The "two identical successors, different provenance" experiment cleanly separates structural authority from behavioral resemblance.
- Clarifies that most current AI discussion conflates identity (sameness) with legitimacy (authorization).
- The unilateral revocation property demonstrates genuine sovereignty—no consent negotiation required.
- Positions authority as mechanically verifiable property, not interpretive judgment ("not narrative inference").
- Sets up future work on defending authority under adversarial pressure (IX.2 establishes it exists, not that it's robust).
- The historical framing ("continuity carried the load") explains why authority-identity confusion was invisible until AI made replacement common.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- How does provenance verification scale to complex multi-step succession chains—does verification cost grow prohibitively?
- Can adversaries forge valid provenance chains, or is cryptographic grounding sufficient—what are attack surfaces?
- What happens when legitimate authority bifurcates (intentional forking)—which successor is legitimate, or both?
- How does this apply to gradient descent / continuous learning—is each training step a "succession" requiring authorization?
- Can biological agents (humans) be understood in this framework—what's our provenance chain?
- If authority can be revoked atomically, who/what performs revocation—doesn't that entity need authority, creating infinite regress?
- How does ASI handle disputed authority (two entities claiming legitimate provenance from same predecessor)?
