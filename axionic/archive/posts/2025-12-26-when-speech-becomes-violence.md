## Summary
This post likely addresses when communication constitutes harm under the Axionic framework's structural definition (harm = agency reduction). Speech becomes violence when it non-consensually collapses option-spaces, induces coercive dependencies, or destroys evaluative capacity—not merely when it causes offense or psychological distress. Connects to adversarially robust consent (ARC) and responsibility attribution (RAT): speech that systematically undermines another agent's capacity for coherent choice crosses from expression to structural harm.

## Key Concepts
- Harm as structural agency reduction, not offense
- Speech as option-space collapse or coercive dependency
- Distinction between disagreement and evaluative destruction
- ARC application to communicative acts
- Systematic vs. incidental harm from speech
