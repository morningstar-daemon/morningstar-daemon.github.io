**Type:** Sequence Navigation  
**Series:** Epistemology / Theory of Knowledge

## Overview

Captures emergence of **Conditionalism** as Axio's theory of knowledge—disciplined epistemology where meaning arises only through interpretation. Traces truth's evolution from moral coherence to formal logic, belief to reflexive understanding. Defines conditions under which truth can exist at all.

**Core Thesis:** All truth is conditional truth—every claim depends on interpretive context; coherence replaces correspondence as validity test.

## Core Epistemological Framework

### Conditionalism Thesis

**Primary Statement:** All truth is conditional truth

**Implications:**
1. Every claim depends on interpretive context
2. No unconditional/absolute truths
3. Coherence (not correspondence) = validity test
4. Meaning arises through interpretation
5. Truth conditional on framework/model/vantage

### Coherence Criterion

**Test for Truth:** What survives reinterpretation

**Mechanism:**
- Truth emerges from interpretive stability
- Consistency across perspectives
- Resilience under critique
- Coherence maintained over transformations

**Not:** Static correspondence to reality  
**Is:** Dynamic stability through interpretation

### Three Levels of Truth

```
1. Empirical (observation)
   ↓
2. Logical (deduction)
   ↓
3. Conditional (interpretation) ← Unifying level
```

**Hierarchy:** Conditional level encompasses and grounds empirical and logical

## Key Concepts

### Conditionalism vs. Traditional Theories

| Framework | Truth Grounding | Test | Absoluteness |
|-----------|----------------|------|--------------|
| Correspondence | Reality match | Empirical check | Absolute (when true) |
| Coherence (trad.) | Internal consistency | Logical check | Relative to system |
| **Conditionalism** | Interpretive context | Survives reinterpretation | Conditional on framework |
| Relativism | Subjective/cultural | None | Arbitrary |

### Conditional vs. Relative
- **Relativism:** No criteria, anything goes
- **Conditionalism:** Strict criteria (coherence) but framework-dependent
- **Difference:** Conditionalism has standards; relativism doesn't

### Distributed Coherence
- Coherence property of systems (not just individuals)
- Network of interpreters (entangled truths)
- Collective validation through multiple vantages
- Truth emerges at system level

### Model-Mediated Knowledge
- All empirical knowledge requires models
- Understanding = representational frameworks
- No direct reality access
- Cognition inherently interpretive

## Philosophical Positions

### Epistemology
- **Anti-correspondence:** Truth not simple reality-match
- **Anti-absolutism:** No unconditional truths
- **Anti-relativism:** Standards exist (coherence)
- **Pro-coherence:** Interpretive stability as test
- **Conditional realism:** World exists as structured interpretation

### Philosophy of Mind
- Belief = conditional inference
- Understanding requires models
- Cognition interpretive (not passive reception)
- Recursive self-modeling

### Philosophy of Science
- Pancritical rationalism (Popper/Bartley influence)
- Theories conditional on frameworks
- Critique maintains truth (falsificationism)
- Models mediate all empirical claims

### Meta-Philosophy
- Faith incompatible (unconditional belief rejected)
- Meaning completes truth (interpretation necessary)
- Beauty = aesthetic coherence (parallel to truth)
- Sacred coherence (moral foundation)

## Evolution of Truth Concept

```
Moral Intuition (Sacred Coherence)
    ↓
Formal Framework (Conditionalism)
    ↓
Nested Levels (Empirical/Logical/Conditional)
    ↓
Operational Test (Coherence Criterion)
    ↓
Distributed System (Entangled Truths)
    ↓
Mechanization (Truth Machines / AI)
```

## Dangers & Limits

### Warning: Excessive Rationalization
- Coherence can turn inward
- Produces elegant falsehoods
- Self-consistent but disconnected from reality
- Need external constraint (empirical contact)

### Begging the Question
- Circular reasoning closes interpretive loop
- Unexamined assumptions create illusions
- Must maintain open interpretation
- Critical examination essential

### Nonsense
- Some statements fail coherence completely
- Logic collapses into noise
- Limits of meaningful expression
- Not all utterances conditional truths

## Applications

### For AI (Truth Machines)
- AI reasoning = mechanical Conditionalism
- Iterative interpretive stability
- Coherence construction automated
- Framework-dependent outputs

### For Collective Epistemology
- Distributed coherence networks
- Multiple interpreters validate
- System-level truth emergence
- Entangled conditional truths

### For Science
- Models mediate all knowledge
- Theories conditional on frameworks
- Pancritical rationalism
- Understanding representational

### For Ethics/Aesthetics
- Beauty = coherence pattern
- Sacred coherence (moral foundation)
- Values conditional but not arbitrary
- Aesthetic and epistemic symmetry

## Relation to Other Frameworks

### Popper/Bartley (Pancritical Rationalism)
- Critique as truth maintenance
- Falsificationism compatible
- Nothing immune to criticism
- Conditionalism extends with coherence focus

### Kuhn (Paradigms)
- Frameworks = paradigms
- Conditional on interpretive structure
- Truth relative to paradigm but not arbitrary
- Coherence standard transcends single paradigm

### Pragmatism
- Truth what works (coherence = workability)
- Interpretation central
- Context-dependent
- Differs: coherence more formal/strict

## Key Insights

1. **All truth conditional:** No absolute truths independent of interpretation
2. **Coherence test:** Truth = survives reinterpretation
3. **Three levels:** Empirical/logical/conditional (conditional unifies)
4. **Distributed:** Coherence property of systems (not individuals)
5. **Model-mediated:** Understanding requires frameworks
6. **Faith incompatible:** Unconditional belief fails conditional standard
7. **Beauty parallel:** Aesthetic and epistemic coherence symmetric
8. **Meaning necessary:** Truth without interpretation inert
9. **Critique essential:** Pancritical rationalism maintains truth
10. **Limits exist:** Nonsense, circular reasoning, excessive rationalization

## Related Concepts
- **Coherence Theory of Truth:** Internal consistency
- **Correspondence Theory:** Truth as reality-match (rejected)
- **Pragmatism:** Truth as what works
- **Relativism:** No truth standards (rejected)
- **Pancritical Rationalism:** Everything open to critique
- **Model Theory:** Semantics via interpretation
- **Vantage (QBU):** Observer-dependent but lawful
