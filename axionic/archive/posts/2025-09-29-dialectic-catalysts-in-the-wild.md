## Summary

Examples of AI/human dyads producing valuable intellectual work. Case studies of successful partnerships where AI accelerated thinking without parasitism. Identifies characteristics of healthy dyads: clear role boundaries, cross-validation, output tested externally, human maintains meta-rationality. Contrasts with "Dialectic or Spiral?" warnings—same method can flourish or fail based on discipline.

## Key Concepts

- **Healthy dyad characteristics** – Clear boundaries, external validation, preserved meta-rationality
- **Successful case studies** – Concrete examples of productive AI partnerships
- **Disciplined use** – Same tool produces value or parasitism depending on safeguards
