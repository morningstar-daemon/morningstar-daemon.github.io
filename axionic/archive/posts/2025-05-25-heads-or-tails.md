## Summary

Illustrates **Measure vs Credence** dynamics via coin flip scenario. **Timeline:** (1) Before -0.5s: Measure = Credence = 0.5 (symmetry). (2) At -0.5s (side chosen): Measure shifts to ~0.51 (empirical bias: upward face slightly favored), Credence stays 0.5 (observer unaware). (3) During flip (0-0.5s): Measure smoothly evolves 0.51 → 1.0 (deterministic physics), Credence stays 0.5 (no new info). (4) After landing: Measure = 1.0, Credence rapidly updates to 1.0 (observation). **Key insight:** Measure (objective probability) evolves continuously with physics; Credence (subjective probability) updates discretely with evidence. Visualizes distinction central to QBU epistemology—objective vs subjective probability dynamics.
