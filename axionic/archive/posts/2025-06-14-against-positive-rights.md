## Summary
This post argues that within Axio's framework, **all valid rights are negative rights**. A valid right is an ethical preference justifiable to enforce through coercion, which itself is defined as credible threat of harm for compliance. Coercion can only be justified defensively (responding to/preventing prior/imminent harm). **Negative rights** (non-interference: freedom from assault, theft, fraud) impose no active obligations beyond restraint, preserving agency. **Positive rights** (healthcare, education, welfare) impose active obligations on others; enforcing them coercively (via taxation, mandates) inherently reduces agency and constitutes harm. Since ethical coercion is exclusively defensive, any coercive enforcement of positive rights is offensive (imposing proactive demands), thus unjustifiable. Voluntary provision (charity, mutual aid) can fulfill societal needs without being enforceable rights—voluntariness removes coercion, distinguishing ethical generosity from enforceable entitlement.

## Key Concepts
- **Valid rights** – Ethical preferences justifiable to enforce coercively; only negative rights qualify.
- **Negative rights** – Non-interference rights requiring only restraint; protect agency without imposing obligations.
- **Positive rights** – Active obligations (provide healthcare, education); coercive enforcement degrades agency.
- **Defensive vs. offensive coercion** – Ethical coercion exclusively defensive; positive rights enforcement is offensive.
- **Agency preservation** – Negative rights align with agency enhancement; positive rights (when coerced) diminish it.
- **Voluntary provision ≠ rights** – Charity/mutual aid ethically commendable but don't constitute enforceable rights.

## Evolution Notes
- Core libertarian position derived rigorously from Axio's definitions of coercion, harm, agency.
- Distinguishes ethical imperatives from enforceable rights—important conceptual separation.
- Connects to agency physics: coercion always costs agency, justifiable only when preventing greater loss.
- Anticipates welfare state critiques, healthcare debates, education policy arguments.
- Establishes rights theory fully consistent with voluntarist ethics.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can we distinguish "degrees" of positive rights (minimal healthcare vs. luxury services)?
- What about children's rights to care—are these positive rights, and if so, how do we justify them?
- Does this framework allow any role for collective insurance mechanisms (e.g., voluntary social insurance)?
- How do we handle transitional justice—restitution for past coercive harms seems like enforcing positive obligations?
