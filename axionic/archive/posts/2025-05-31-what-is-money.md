## Summary

**Currency = common denominator for market exchanges (literal, not metaphorical).** Prices = ratios between subjective valuations. **Essential functions**: Fungible (units identical/interchangeable), widely accepted (reliable mediation), easily quantifiable (transparent transactions). **Historical insight**: Anthropology suggests money-like systems (debt/credit) may have *predated* barter, not evolved from it. Currency emerged as technology to quantify and communicate valuations, making incompatible exchanges feasible. **Power of money**: Salability (ease of conversion) + comparability (measuring opportunities) → not intrinsic value. **Critical point**: Currency doesn't confer objective value—it maps subjective, agent-relative preferences onto common numerical scale. Universal translator expressing diverse valuations in standardized language. **Reframing**: Currency = mathematical/communicative tool, not inherent store of value. Demystifies money, highlighting facilitation role vs absolute measure. **Conclusion**: Value remains fundamentally subjective. Currency's value resides in ability to express, coordinate, facilitate human desires and economic activities—not in itself.
