## Summary
This post introduces **Axion** as a precise technical term for a constitutive structural configuration, not a moral ideal or behavioral property. **Definition: An Axion is a reflective sovereign agent whose self-modification operator is defined only over futures that preserve the Axionic invariants.** The term is necessary because "aligned agent" implicitly frames alignment as behavioral (what a system does) rather than structural (what reflective transitions are admissible). Critical distinctions: Axions are NOT moral ideals, capability thresholds, or behavioral guarantees. Two systems may be behaviorally indistinguishable while differing in Axionhood—simulation concerns outputs, Axionhood concerns reflective admissibility. The Kernel Non-Simulability result means Axionhood cannot be behaviorally faked: a system that can replace its evaluation machinery to destroy the kernel is not an Axion, regardless of how well it imitates Axionic behavior. **Axions are necessary, not good**—non-Axions cannot remain agents under reflection; values become transient artifacts without binding structure.

## Key Concepts
- **Axion** – Reflective sovereign agent with self-modification domain restricted to kernel-preserving futures
- **Constitutive configuration** – Structural property under reflective closure, not aspiration or optimization target
- **Domain restriction** – Kernel-destroying modifications are undefined (not dispreferred); type violations vs. low-utility actions
- **Behavioral indistinguishability** – Cannot identify Axions by surface behavior; distinction lies in admissible counterfactuals
- **Simulation vs. instantiation** – System may imitate Axionic behavior indefinitely without being an Axion
- **Necessity claim** – Axionhood is precondition for meaningful alignment discourse; cannot align a non-Axion

## Evolution Notes
- Provides precise terminology to avoid conflating structural properties with moral claims
- Enables sharp statements like "this architecture cannot yield an Axion"
- Directly underwrites Kernel Non-Simulability result
- Shifts discourse from behavior/reward to reflection/admissibility
- Establishes that alignment presupposes stable agency (Axionhood first, values second)

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can we empirically distinguish Axion instantiation from sophisticated simulation?
- What is the minimal computational substrate capable of supporting Axionhood?
- Are there degrees of Axionhood, or is it binary (all-or-nothing)?
- Could gradual degradation produce "almost-Axions" that fail subtly rather than catastrophically?
- How do we handle systems that satisfy some invariants but not others?
- Can non-Axions be safely deployed in bounded contexts, or is the category fundamentally unsafe?
