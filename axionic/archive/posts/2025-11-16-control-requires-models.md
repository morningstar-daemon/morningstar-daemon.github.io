## Core Thesis

**Control presupposes representation.** Any regulator capable of reliable control must embody a model of the system it regulates. Not rhetorical—precise demonstration that **control and representation are inseparable.** Unless controller preserves distinctions present in system, cannot consistently select appropriate actions.

**Source:** Good Regulator Theorem (Conant & Ashby, 1970)

> "Regulation, in this sense, is an applied form of model-based cognition."

## The Good Regulator Theorem

### Statement

[Good Regulator Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_regulator_theorem) (Conant & Ashby, 1970):

> **Any regulator capable of achieving reliable control must embody a model of the system it regulates.**

### Formal Insight

**If system occupies range of distinguishable states:**
- Regulator succeeding across that range must encode **at least the distinctions relevant to deciding actions**
- Must contain representation sufficient to map states → interventions
- Mapping must preserve system's causal structure

**Not optional:** Inadequate internal modeling → control failure

### Control Failure Mechanism

**When regulator lacks proper distinctions:**
- Responds identically to states requiring different interventions
- Applies inappropriate corrections
- Cannot reliably achieve goals

**Cause:** Inadequate internal modeling

## Regulation and Representation

### What Regulation Requires

**To regulate a system:**
1. Map observed states → corrective interventions
2. Distinguish states calling for different responses
3. Predict consequences of actions

**Requirements = structured internal mapping** mirroring relevant system structure

### Cybernetic Formulation

**Homomorphism required:**
- Regulator's internal organization must preserve distinctions necessary for reliable action
- Between system and regulator
- Structural correspondence

### Model Definition (Broad)

**Not necessarily equations or scientific model**

**Any representational structure that:**
- Differentiates among possible system states
- Identifies appropriate transitions
- Maps states to interventions

**Examples:**
- Enzyme pathways (biological)
- Homeostatic loops
- Neural reflexes
- Scientific models
- All exhibit implicit environmental/internal dynamics models

## Control as Representational Task

### Core Process

**Regulator constructs/maintains:**
- Mapping: perceived conditions → actions
- Actions expected to bring system closer to target
- **Presupposes predictions** about system evolution under interventions

### Key Distinction

**Predictive adequacy** (not mechanical reaction) distinguishes effective regulation

**Mechanism:**
- Internal structure reflects system regularities
- Anticipates responses
- Selects appropriate interventions

## Domain Examples

### 1. Aircraft Autopilot
- Must encode aerodynamic behavior
- Maps sensor readings → control surface adjustments
- Stabilizes flight via model of aircraft dynamics

### 2. Thermostat
- Maps temperature readings → heating/cooling decisions
- Based on environment dynamics model
- Simple but embodies system structure

### 3. Central Nervous System
- Integrates sensory data with internal states
- Maintains homeostasis
- Complex distributed model of body/environment

### 4. Markets (Distributed Regulation)
- Encode decentralized information
- Preferences, constraints, opportunities
- Emergent regulatory model

### 5. Political Systems
- Falter when regulating without sufficient informational structure
- Need adequate model of governed system
- Control failure from model inadequacy

### 6. AI Agents
- Must construct/acquire models of human behavior
- To act coherently with respect to human values
- Alignment = adequate human model

**Pattern:** Successful control derives from internal structure reflecting regulated system regularities

## Axio Integration

### Agency as Model-Based Regulation

**Axio characterization:**
- Agency = capacity to select actions based on expectations
- Expectations = structured anticipations of world response
- Good Regulator Theorem aligns perfectly

**Requirements for Agency:**
- Model of environment
- Model of task
- Model of own possible interventions

**Without model:** Action reduces to **blind reaction** (lacks intentional behavior structure)

### Conditionalism Connection

**Parallel structure:**

| Understanding | Agency |
|---------------|--------|
| Empirical truth conditional on interpretive background | Agency conditional on representational structure |
| Knowledge model-mediated | Regulation model-based |
| Coherence of model determines understanding | Coherence of model determines regulation |

**Unified principle:** Both comprehension and control require models

**Framework:** Regulation occurs within model; goals, errors, corrections defined relative to structure

## Broader Implications

### For Biology
- **Evolution of internal models:** Survival depends on regulation
- Organisms encode environment/self-dynamics
- Natural selection for modeling capacity
- Homeostasis = regulatory success

### For Economics
- **Markets as distributed regulators:** Function by encoding decentralized information
- Price signals = model components
- Market failure = model inadequacy
- Information aggregation essential

### For Politics
- **Governance requires adequate models:** Cannot regulate without informational structure
- Failed states = inadequate system models
- Centralized planning problems = model complexity limits
- Distributed knowledge coordination

### For AI Alignment
- **Must model human values:** To regulate toward them
- Alignment problem = adequate human model problem
- Cannot control what you can't model
- Coherent action requires representation

### For Philosophy of Mind
- **Intentionality requires models:** Blind reaction ≠ intentional action
- Purpose presupposes anticipation
- Beliefs/desires as model components
- Mental representation necessary for agency

## Companion Thesis

### Understanding Requires Models (Previous Essay)

**Comprehension:** Necessarily model-mediated
- No direct world access
- Representations organize perception, guide expectation

**Control Requires Models (This Essay):**

**Effective action:** Necessarily model-based
- Regulation inseparable from representation
- Control = applied model-based cognition

**Combined:** **Both understanding AND action require models**

### Unified Framework

```
Reality (inaccessible directly)
    ↓
Models (representational structures)
    ↓
Understanding (model-mediated comprehension)
    ↓
Control (model-based regulation)
    ↓
Effective Action (intentional behavior)
```

## Key Insights

1. **Control inseparable from representation:** Not optional
2. **Models enable regulation:** Encode relevant distinctions
3. **Homomorphism required:** Internal structure mirrors system
4. **Predictive not reactive:** Anticipation distinguishes effective control
5. **Broad definition:** Even simple mechanisms embody models
6. **Universal requirement:** Biology, markets, politics, AI all need models
7. **Agency presupposes models:** Intentional action = model-based
8. **Conditionalism applies:** Regulation conditional on framework
9. **Control failure = model failure:** Inadequate representation → regulation breakdown
10. **Applied cognition:** Regulation is model-based cognition in action

> "A model, in this context, is any representational structure that differentiates among possible states of the system and identifies appropriate transitions."

> "Control failure is therefore a consequence of inadequate internal modelling."

> "Predictive adequacy, not mechanical reaction, is what distinguishes effective regulation."

> "Without such a model, action reduces to blind reaction, lacking the structure necessary for intentional behaviour."

> "Just as empirical truth is conditional on interpretive background, agency is conditional on representational structure."

> "Control presupposes representation. To influence a system reliably, an agent must encode the distinctions pertinent to that system's behaviour."
