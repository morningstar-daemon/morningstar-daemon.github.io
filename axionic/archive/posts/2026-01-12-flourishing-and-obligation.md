## Summary
This essay critiques Objectivist ethics from an Axionic perspective, acknowledging its strengths (rejection of self-sacrifice, emphasis on agency, coherence) while challenging its claim to objective moral authority. Objectivism grounds morality in effectiveness—principles justified by supporting survival, flourishing, productivity. Axionics argues this conflates instrumental success (what works given a goal) with ethical authority (which reasons may bind an agent). Terminal values (human life, flourishing, rational self-interest) appear in Objectivism as discoveries rather than commitments requiring endorsement. The essay identifies fragilities: egoism relies on convergence not constraint (fails under adversarial conditions with asymmetric power); voluntariness treated as binary when consent admits degrees/defeasibility; lacks mechanism distinguishing guidance from governance when scaled to politics. Axionic reframe: Objectivism becomes valuable recommendation for agents endorsing certain commitments, not moral law. Axionics addresses prior question: what must remain intact for moral questions to make sense at all—preservation of coherent agency under reflection.

## Key Concepts
- **Instrumental success vs. ethical authority** – Effectiveness describes what works given goals; authority concerns which reasons may bind agents; Objectivism conflates these.
- **Terminal values require endorsement** – Flourishing/rational self-interest acquire normative force only through agent commitment; prior to adoption, lack binding authority; Objectivism treats them as discoveries.
- **Axionic criterion** – Preservation of coherent agency under reflection: evaluability, consent, semantic integrity, legitimacy of reasons; operates before particular values specified.
- **Structural objectivity** – Coherence conditions admit objective assessment; Objectivism extends objectivity into value content itself (virtues/ends authoritative by correctness).
- **Egoism's fragility** – Objectivist egoism assumes predation/deception undermine agent (trust erosion, self-esteem); holds for typical agents in open environments; fails under adversarial conditions (asymmetric power, enclosure, non-typical psychology).
- **Voluntariness limitations** – Formal choice intact doesn't secure legitimacy; agency impaired by manipulation, desperation, information asymmetry; Objectivism treats consent as binary when it admits degrees.
- **Guidance vs. governance** – Objectivism lacks mechanism distinguishing recommendation from enforcement; moral principles vulnerable to appropriation by power when scaled.
- **Agency as fixed point** – Not one value among others; the condition under which all valuation occurs; systems undermining agency forfeit authority regardless of practical success.

## Evolution Notes
- Positions Axionics relative to established philosophical system (Objectivism/Rand), clarifying distinctions.
- The "agency as infrastructure" framing grounds Axionic ethics more precisely than earlier posts.
- Distinguishes structural constraints (objective) from value commitments (requiring endorsement).
- The egoism critique shows how Axionics handles adversarial conditions Objectivism assumes away.
- Establishes pattern for Axionic engagement with other ethical frameworks: identify what survives scrutiny (virtues as policies, agency emphasis) vs. what doesn't (claims to universal binding authority).

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- Can any ethical framework claim binding authority beyond endorsement without collapsing into authoritarianism?
- How does Axionics handle edge cases where preserving agency requires temporarily constraining it (addiction, severe mental illness)?
- If terminal values require endorsement, how do agents bootstrap initial commitments—isn't there infinite regress?
- Does the Objectivist egoism fail only under adversarial conditions, or does Axionics claim it's structurally inadequate even in typical cases?
- Can the distinction between "guidance" and "governance" be formalized into institutional design principles?
- How does Axionic ethics handle value pluralism when agents with intact agency endorse fundamentally incompatible commitments?
- What meta-ethical status does the Axionic criterion itself have—is it discovered, stipulated, or something else?
