# Global Anarchy

## Summary
This post dismantles the popular myth that the world operates under "international law" in any meaningful legal sense. Axio argues that the international system is fundamentally anarchic—not chaotic, but lacking a sovereign authority above nation-states. What we call international law is actually coordinated etiquette sustained by mutual interest and the balance of power, not genuine enforcement machinery. Unlike domestic law backed by police and courts, international law has no enforcement mechanism beyond voluntary compliance and political will. The post uses examples like Israel's strikes in Yemen, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and America's invasion of Iraq to illustrate that great powers can ignore "law" with impunity unless other sovereigns choose to intervene. This is not disorder but rather order without hierarchy—a lattice of norms and agreements maintained through reciprocity and shadowed by power. The key insight: we already live in global anarchy, and recognizing this clarifies rather than undermines the nature of international coordination.

## Key Concepts
- **Anarchy vs. Chaos** – Anarchy properly means absence of sovereign authority, not disorder; the international system is anarchic by design.
- **International Law as Etiquette** – Treaties and norms are coordination mechanisms sustained by mutual interest, not commands from a higher authority.
- **Enforcement Gap** – Unlike domestic law backed by police and prisons, international law lacks machinery to compel compliance.
- **Power as Regulator** – The balance of power between states, not legal authority, determines outcomes in international conflicts.
- **Fragile Coordination** – International order exists through reciprocity and shared interests, not coercive hierarchy.
- **Sovereignty All the Way Down** – No world government exists; sovereignty remains with individual states.

## Evolution Notes
- Connects to Axio's broader critique of state monopolies and defense of decentralized governance models.
- Prefigures later discussions of axiocracy and governance without governments by showing how order can emerge without centralized authority.
- Relates to earlier posts on liberty and agency protection by questioning whether centralized enforcement is necessary for order.
- Provides empirical grounding for anarchist political theory by showing global anarchy already exists and functions.
- Challenges progressive assumptions about international institutions having binding authority.

## Cross-References



## Open Questions
- If global anarchy already functions through reciprocity and power balance, what would justify creating a world government?
- Can the anarchic coordination model scale down to replace domestic state monopolies on violence?
- How do we distinguish productive international norms (trade agreements, diplomatic conventions) from destructive ones (arms races, territorial disputes)?
- What role should decentralized technologies (cryptocurrency, encrypted communication) play in reinforcing global anarchy against attempts at centralization?
- Does the success of international coordination without hierarchy provide a model for AI alignment without centralized control?
