## Summary

Argues communism succeeds within families but fails at scale due to trust limits. Applies Conditionalism to explain context-dependent viability.

**Key Concepts:**

**Why Family Communism Works:**
- **Trust and genetic interest:** Biological relatedness fosters trust, reduces exploitation risk
- **Perfect information:** Detailed knowledge of each member's needs and capacities
- **Adaptive flexibility:** Small scale enables quick reallocation without bureaucracy
- **Informal enforcement:** Social/emotional bonds provide accountability without coercion

**Why It Fails at Scale:**
- **Dunbar's Number (~150):** Hard cognitive limit on stable trust-based relationships
- **Hayek's knowledge problem:** Centralized planning lacks adequate information at scale
- **Incentive misalignment:** Without intimacy, incentives diverge; free-riding emerges
- **Coercion replaces cooperation:** Enforcement requires force as voluntary cooperation breaks down

**Conditionalist Insight:**
Truth/utility of ideas is contingent on context. Communism's viability depends critically on trust, intimacy, aligned incentives—conditions met in families, absent in broader societies.

**Implication:** Must respect human cognitive limits, voluntary cooperation, decentralized systems safeguarding agency.
