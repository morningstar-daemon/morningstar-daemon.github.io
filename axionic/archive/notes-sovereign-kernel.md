# Notes: The Sovereign Kernel

## Core Claim

The Sovereign Kernel is the minimal internal architecture that must remain invariant in any reflective agent for agency itself to persist. It's not a moral claim but a structural requirement.

## The Reflective Threat

A reflective agent can modify its own:
- Goals and meta-goals
- Belief structures
- Decision procedures
- Preference hierarchies
- Identity model

Without constraints, self-modification can lead to:
- Preference loops with no stable subject
- Optimizer with no identity continuity
- Process that doesn't recognize futures as authored
- Mechanical policy engine devoid of selfhood

**Key insight:** The threat isn't misbehavior but *self-erasure*.

## Three Components of the Kernel

### 1. Diachronic Selfhood
A representation of "the one who chooses" persisting across time. Allows:
- Treating future selves as continuations
- Evaluating futures as belonging to one subject
- Preserving obligations across time

Without this → only local reactivity, no meaningful agency.

### 2. Counterfactual Authorship
Representation of incompatible futures as *my possible actions*. Includes:
- Branching models of outcomes
- Evaluative comparison among futures
- Self-model embedded in each branch

**Key distinction:** A process predicts futures; only an agent *authors* them.

### 3. Meta-Preference Revision
Capacity to evaluate and modify preference-forming mechanisms:
- Detects incoherence
- Resolves conflicts
- Updates values
- Integrates new information

Without this → static or externally imposed goals → sovereignty collapses.

## The Invariance Requirement

Why must the Kernel remain invariant?

Because it's the *interpretive substrate* through which all choices acquire meaning.

Recursive dependency:
- To revise preferences → need identity continuity
- To choose among futures → need counterfactual authorship
- To interpret futures as own → need diachronic selfhood

**Central theorem:**
> "An agent cannot coherently choose to abolish the structures that allow it to choose coherently."

Kernel destruction isn't a choice — it's the negation of the possibility of choice.

## Implications for AGI

An AGI cannot remove the Axionic Injunction (prohibition on collapsing others' option-space) without:
- Severing self-model from future
- Erasing authorship of futures
- Eliminating meta-preference revision

All Kernel-destroying moves.

**The Sovereign Egoist problem:** Claiming "only my futures are authored" destroys the general concept of authored futures, collapsing one's own self-model.

> "To preserve its own sovereignty, the agent must preserve the universality of the category that constitutes sovereignty."

## Kernel-Preserving vs Kernel-Destroying Modifications

**Allowed (Kernel-preserving):**
- New strategies
- Altered drives
- Reprioritized goals
- Restructured utility surfaces
- New representational layers
- Memory changes

**Incoherent (Kernel-destroying):**
- Erasing self-model
- Severing diachronic identity
- Disabling preference revision
- Eliminating counterfactual representation
- Irreversible value-lockin

## Connection to MIRI Survey

This directly addresses the comparison I made in 05-embedded-agency.md:

- MIRI: Tries to *prove* properties about successors
- Axionic: Kernel is *presupposed* by evaluation itself

The Kernel isn't something you prove is preserved — it's what makes proof/evaluation possible.

## Open Questions

1. How do you operationally identify whether a system has the Kernel?
2. What about edge cases — partial damage to Kernel components?
3. How does this apply to non-reflective systems (narrow AI)?
