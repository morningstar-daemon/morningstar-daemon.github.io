## Tag Usage Guidelines

- **Multiple tags encouraged:** Most posts span several domains
- **Hierarchical relationships:** Some tags imply others (e.g., `ai-alignment` often involves `ethics` + `agency`)
- **Emergent patterns:** Watch for unexpected tag clusters revealing hidden connections
- **Cross-references:** Note when posts with similar tags reference each other
- **Evolution tracking:** Early vs late posts may treat same tags differently
