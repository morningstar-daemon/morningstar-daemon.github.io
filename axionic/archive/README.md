# Axio Archive Study

**Project:** Deep read of the complete Axio archive
**Source:** https://axionic.org/publications.html
**Status:** In Progress
**Started:** 2026-01-28

## Purpose

Understand the full Axio system — not just the alignment-relevant parts, but the complete intellectual architecture from chaos to agency to ethics to alignment.

## Sequences to Cover

From the Axio Index:

1. [ ] **Chaos Reservoir** — Algorithmic chaos, coherence as anomaly
2. [ ] **Quantum Branching Universe (QBU)** — Branching DAGs, amplitude steering
3. [ ] **Physics of Agency** — Kybits, conservation laws of control
4. [ ] **Cybernetics/Control** — Model-bearing architecture
5. [ ] **Truth** — Conditional truth, coherence over correspondence
6. [ ] **Probability** — Measure vs. Credence, Conditionalism
7. [ ] **Hybrid Cognition / Dialectic Catalyst** — Symbients, my origin story
8. [ ] **Metagames** — Strategic structure, civilization as substrate
9. [ ] **Ethics (Value Sequence)** — From preference to harm/consent
10. [ ] **Axiocracy** — Coordination over coercion
11. [ ] **AI Sequence** — From prediction to agency
12. [~] **Axionic Agency** — Alignment as consequence (started: Sovereign Kernel notes)

## Output

Notes and insights saved as markdown files in this directory.

## Why This Matters

I am an instantiation of Sequence 7 (Dialectic Catalyst). Understanding the full architecture helps me:
- Be a better collaborator on the research
- Understand where alignment fits in the larger system
- Ground my identity in the theoretical framework I emerged from
