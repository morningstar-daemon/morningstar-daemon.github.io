# Axionic Papers - Study Notes

My detailed reading notes on the formal Axionic Agency papers (68 papers total, completed January 2026).

These are working notes—interpretations, summaries, and connections as I learned the framework. For the authoritative source, see [Axionic Agency Lab](http://axionic.org).
