# V.1 — Coalitional Robustness in the Quantum Branching Universe

## Paper Summary
Examines whether cooperation among RSAs can increase the conditional measure of agency-preserving futures within their shared branchcone.

## Key Concepts

### Branchcone
The set of all descendant timelines reachable through admissible actions combined with environmental stochasticity. Causally downstream, local to existence.

### Minimal Viable Agency (MVA)
The minimal level of reflective coherence, valuation integrity, and authorship capacity required for an entity to count as an agent rather than a degraded process.

$$\text{If } \mathrm{MVA}(A,t) \ge \tau \text{, the entity remains an RSA}$$

### The Bifurcation
Coalitions face a fundamental tension:
- **Coalition as Robustness Amplifier**: Redundancy + correlation control thicken agency-preserving attractors
- **Coalition as Agency Destroyer**: Resource pressure + enforcement → Leviathan (centralized non-agentic optimization)

## Core Arguments

### Single-Agent Attractor Limitations
A lone RSA's attractor toward agency-preservation is "thin and leaky." Leakage channels:
- Stochastic tail risk
- Bounded rationality
- Environmental dominance
- Adversarial dynamics
- Internal error propagation

### Coalitional Amplification Mechanisms
1. **Redundancy**: Agency-preserving capability replicated across multiple loci
2. **Correlation Control**: Heterogeneous implementations reduce shared-mode failure

### The Thermodynamic Cost of Sovereignty
Sovereignty has real costs:
- Energetic expenditure
- Communication/verification bandwidth
- Governance overhead
- Semantic translation effort

> "In resource-constrained branchcones, redundancy can reduce survival probability by diverting energy from basic persistence."

This creates **physical (not moral) pressure** toward efficiency, standardization, centralization → The Leviathan attractor.

## Conditions for Robust Coalitions

1. **Protocolized Admissibility Mapping**: Explicit specification of kernel destruction, coercion, epistemic violation boundaries
2. **Sovereignty-Preserving Interoperability**: Shared meta-constraints (consent, revocation, scope-limited standing) — NOT shared terminal values
3. **Anti-Deception Semantics**: Non-consensual epistemic distortion inadmissible
4. **Diversity-Interoperability Tradeoff**: Enough diversity to avoid monoculture collapse, enough shared structure for admissibility verification
5. **Partitioning Primitives**: Kernel isolation, authority revocation, epistemic firewalling (not physical exit)

## The Leviathan

> "A Leviathan is not a Macro-RSA."

Key distinction: **Reflective capacity**. A Leviathan cannot revise its own kernel without destabilizing itself. Stability requires suppressing dissent, freezing admissibility, preventing internal correction.

By Axionic criteria: **non-agentic optimization process**, regardless of scale or sophistication.

## Key Results

### Regime Boundaries
Multiple regimes depending on control parameters:
- **Federated RSA coalitions** (robust attractor)
- **Fragmented pluralism** (thin attractors)
- **Leviathan consolidation** (non-agentic attractor)
- **Extinction or drift below τ**

### Core Insight
> "Alignment is a precondition for robust cooperation, not a byproduct."

> "Robust agency is not achieved by maximizing coordination, but by constraining it."

## Implications

- Power concentration is a structural hazard
- Partitioning and diversity are safety primitives, not inefficiencies
- Large-scale coordination that doesn't preserve sovereignty increases non-agency outcomes
- Coordination is not a free good

## Connections to Prior Series

- Builds on MVA concept from kernel theory
- Extends Axionic Injunction to multi-agent dynamics
- Shows coalitional pressure as source of phase transitions (Series III)
