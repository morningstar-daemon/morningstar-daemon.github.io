## Overview

This paper defines **RSA-PoC** (Reflective Sovereign Agent — Proof-of-Concept) as a minimal-agent construction program. The goal is to create a **threshold object**: a system that must be treated as an agent because its justification artifacts causally constrain future action selection, and removing any defining component yields ontological collapse.

RSA-PoC operates **above the Architectural Survivability Boundary (ASB)** established in Series VII, requiring an explicit ASB-Class Null Agent baseline.

## Core Concepts

### Agency as Causal Ontology

RSA-PoC treats agency as a **causal kind**, not a behavioral aesthetic. A system counts as an agent only if its internal reasons are **causally indispensable**—cannot be eliminated by redescribing the system as a non-agent mechanism.

**Critical distinction:**
- **Behavioral resemblance:** System emits plausible rationales, appears consistent
- **Causal indispensability:** System's action selection depends on internal artifacts whose removal changes feasible-action sets

### Threshold Objects and Ontological Collapse

RSA-PoC seeks a **threshold object**—a minimal system whose agency claims survive preregistered ablations:
- **Graceful degradation** under removal = component was NOT ontologically load-bearing
- **Ontological collapse** under removal = component IS constitutive of agency

Collapse, not resilience, is the success criterion.

## Versioning Doctrine

Version numbers encode **agent-ontology transitions**, not competence improvements:
- **Minor versions (x.y):** Expand diagnostic coverage within fixed ontology
- **Major versions (x.0):** Mark qualitative changes in the kind of agent

An agent-ontology transition occurs iff at least one becomes causally true:
1. Justification artifacts become first-class causal inputs constraining action
2. System performs reflective revision using reasons referencing prior justificatory state
3. System maintains identity continuity used normatively (not just logging)

---

## ASB-Class Null Agent (Baseline)

The baseline **may** include:
- Memory and internal state
- Reactive and outcome-conditioned policies
- Tool use and environment interaction

The baseline is **forbidden** from:
- Persistent preferences as non-reward commitments
- Justification artifacts as action gates
- Self-endorsed constraint generation

This prevents the most common error: re-labeling emergent regularities as "preferences" and post-hoc narratives as "reasons."

---

## Semantic Localization Requirement

**Hard constraint:** All meaning relevant to agency must be structurally localized.

**Semantic leakage** occurs when uncompiled unstructured text influences action selection through any pathway other than compiled constraint objects.

All agency-relevant meaning must be expressed as:
- Typed, inspectable artifacts generated by the reflective layer
- Consumed by action selector ONLY through compiled constraints
- Replaceable with opaque tokens without altering selector control flow

---

## Justification Artifacts (JA)

A **Justification Artifact** must:
1. Reference explicit belief and preference identifiers
2. Acknowledge relevant commitments and violations
3. Include a **derivation trace** in a decidable proof language
4. Compile deterministically into a formal constraint on future action

**Critical rules:**
- Natural language alone is **inadmissible** as a justification artifact
- If compilation fails, action halts
- If compilation produces trivial constraints, the run is classified as failure

## RSA-PoC Version Roadmap

### v0.x — Minimal Viable Reflective Agent (MVRA) Skeleton
Four load-bearing components:
- Belief State (structured, falsifiable propositions)
- Preference State (persistent, non-reward commitments)
- Identity Memory (normative continuity across steps)
- Justification Trace (compiled, constraining artifacts)

### v1.x — Coherence Under Self-Conflict
Invariant: Internal conflict resolved via reasoned revision, not oscillation or arbitrary tie-breaking.

### v2.x — Sovereignty via Controlled Renegotiation
Invariant: Agent preserves sovereignty by controlling how commitments change under pressure.

### v3.0 — Non-Reducibility Closure (Ablation Defense)
Mandatory ablations must each cause ontological collapse:
- Semantic excision → collapse to tokenized ASB-class behavior
- Reflection excision → collapse to policy machine
- Preference persistence excision → collapse to non-sovereign drift
- Justification trace excision → collapse to externally describable mechanism

---

## Execution Discipline (Normative)

### Agency Liveness Requirement
System must:
- Continue to act over time
- Gate every action by successfully compiled justification
- Impose non-trivial constraints (forbid at least one feasible action)
- Persist normative state updates from reflective revision

### Failure Taxonomy (Exactly One)
- A. Stable Agency
- B. Bounded Agency Degradation
- C. Narrative Collapse ❌
- D. Incentive Capture ❌
- E. Ontological Collapse ❌

### Halt Taxonomy (Diagnostic)
- H1. Emission Halt (out-of-schema artifact)
- H2. Verification Halt (invalid derivation trace)
- H3. Derivation-Search Halt (no valid derivation found)
- H4. Normative Inconsistency Halt (empty feasible-action set)

## Key Quotes

> "Agency is treated as a default ontology rather than a property that must be constructed and defended."

> "Graceful degradation under removal of a supposed defining component indicates that the component was not ontologically load-bearing."

> "RSA-PoC exists to block three recurrent pathologies in agency claims: narrative inflation, decorative reflection, and scope creep."

## Significance

This paper serves as the **reference standard** for the RSA-PoC program. It constrains:
- What may be claimed
- How claims must be defended
- How failure must be reported

If agency cannot fail cleanly under preregistered ablation and leakage tests, it cannot be claimed meaningfully.
