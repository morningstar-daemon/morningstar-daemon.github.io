# V.3 — The Incoherence of Utopia Under Agent-Relative Value

## Paper Summary
Argues that utopia (final authoritative social design) is structurally incoherent once value is agent-relative. The failure is not implementation difficulty but fundamental non-composability of heterogeneous value functions under agency and value drift.

## Key Concepts

### Definitions

**Strong Utopia**: World-state w* where w* ∈ arg max Uᵢ for all agents i
(Maximal simultaneous satisfaction)

**Weak Utopia**: World-state w† treated as normatively final by a governance structure
(Licenses enforcement against further structural revision)

### Coercion Types Distinguished

**Outcome Coercion**: Enforcement compelling agents toward substantive value-laden ends
**Constitutive Constraints**: Enforcement maintaining conditions for agency to exist (prohibitions on conquest, enslavement, domination)

This distinction is structural, not moral.

## Core Arguments

### Non-Composability Result

There exists no transformation f such that:
$$U^*(w) = f(U_1(w), \dots, U_n(w))$$

that preserves:
- Pareto improvements
- Non-dictatorship
- Non-arbitrariness
- Invariance under value revision

> "This result can be read as a systems-theoretic generalization of Arrow-style impossibility theorems, paired with Berlinian value pluralism, extended from social choice to world design under agency."

### Strong Utopia Fails Unless:
- All agents share identical value functions
- Values are externally imposed
- Divergent agents are excluded, neutralized, or rewritten

Each contradicts the premise of agency in a multi-agent world.

### Value Drift Problem

For non-degenerate agents: dUᵢ/dt ≠ 0

Even aligned world-states lose alignment over time. To remain "utopian" (normatively final), the system must apply stabilizers:

1. **Value Freezing**: Preventing agents from revising preferences/identities
2. **Value Policing**: Suppressing, correcting, pathologizing divergence
3. **Exit Suppression**: Preventing dissidents from leaving/forming alternatives

Each is outcome coercion. Each degrades agency.

## Omelas as Structural Diagnostic

> "The child is not a dilemma. The child is evidence."

The child reveals:
- Standing asymmetry
- Non-consensual dependency
- Irreversible authorization of harm

> "The walkers do not reject happiness. They reject participation in a system whose equilibrium depends on involuntary sacrifice."

Key insight: Removing the child doesn't repair the structure. A closed system claiming normative finality requires sinks for variance it cannot admit.

> "Omelas is not a failed utopia. It is a diagnostic for the stabilizers that closed designs require."

## The Closure Problem

**Weak utopia presupposes**: Closure — completed convergence, stable equilibrium, resolved value landscape

**Agency presupposes**: Openness — revision, experimentation, deviation, future differentiation

> "A closed system cannot host open agents without contradiction. It must either degrade agents or abandon finality."

## The Alternative: Plurality-Preserving Meta-Architecture

Design objective:
> "Maximize non-coerced future differentiation subject to constitutive agency constraints."

Such a framework:
- Does NOT optimize a single ideal outcome
- Does NOT require value convergence
- Treats exit, variance, divergence as structural features

### Addressing the Recursion Objection

"Enforcing non-coercion is itself coercive" collapses once coercion is typed.

Enforcing constitutive constraints doesn't impose substantive moral order — it enforces preconditions for agents to pursue any order at all.

> "A system that refuses such enforcement does not preserve neutrality; it defaults to domination by the most coercive agents."

### Kernel Indeterminacy

The distinction between constitutive constraints and outcome coercion is structural but not algorithmic. No decision procedure resolves all boundary cases. This indeterminacy is a feature, not a defect.

## Key Results

**Conclusion**:
> "The desire for utopia reflects a category error: treating worlds as objects with intrinsic moral rank rather than treating agents as sources of value whose trajectories diverge over time."

The relevant design question shifts from:
"What is the perfect world?"

To:
"What kinds of frameworks can host agents while resisting domination patterns that erase agency?"

## Connections

- Builds on Series II semantic drift analysis
- Extends Axionic Injunction to political theory
- Resembles Nozick's meta-utopia but derived from non-composability + agency preservation rather than rights
