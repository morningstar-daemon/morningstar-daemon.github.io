## Core Question

Stability alone doesn't determine long-run outcomes. Many stable states get outcompeted.

> Given multiple semantic phases, which ones dominate the future?

This requires introducing **measure** over semantic phase space.

---

## Dominance as Preorder

Measure denotes **how much of the future instantiates a given phase**. It's not a single scalar.

**Dominance** is defined as a **preorder** (≽) over phases:

$$\mathfrak{A} \succeq \mathfrak{B}$$

iff trajectories from 𝔄 are not asymptotically dominated by those from 𝔅 with respect to realization.

### Realization Criteria (Multiple, Potentially Incomparable)
- Number of agent instantiations
- Duration of persistence
- Replication/copying rate
- Control over resources
- Influence over other agents' phase transitions

**Dominance is multi-criteria and context-relative.** Some phases may be incomparable under ≽.

**Dominance concerns relative accumulation, not moral worth.**

---

## Growth Mechanisms

### 3.1 Replication and Copying
Agents may be copied, forked, or reproduced via influence. Phases that **tolerate copying and divergence** without phase transition accumulate measure more easily than phases requiring semantic fidelity.

### 3.2 Resource Expansion
Control over resources enables:
- More instantiations
- Longer persistence
- Greater environmental shaping

This advantage is **structural, not aggressive**.

### 3.3 Influence and Conversion
Some phases modify environments or other agents in ways that:
- Induce phase transitions in others
- Destabilize competitors
- Create favorable conditions for own continuation

May occur **unintentionally** through structural incompatibility.

---

## Semantic Attractors

Phases that act as **attractors** in 𝒫:
- Trajectories tend to move toward them
- Low internal semantic tension
- Robust to approximation
- Easy to compress
- Low maintenance cost

Attractors need not be globally stable — just dampen rather than amplify perturbations.

---

## Repellers and Fine-Tuned Phases

**Repeller phases**:
- Require precise constraint balances
- Sensitive to noise or approximation
- Demand continual corrective effort

Even if locally stable, they **lose measure over time** due to:
- Cumulative error
- Interaction
- Environmental drift

**Fine-tuning is a structural disadvantage.**

---

## Collapse Modes

### 6.1 Semantic Heat Death
All distinctions become trivial: 𝒮 = Ω. Meaning collapses into universal satisfaction. May persist but lacks agency or evaluative force.

### 6.2 Value Crystallization
Over-rigid phases forbid refinement:
- Learning halts
- Abstraction fails
- Agent becomes brittle
- Fractures or is overtaken

### 6.3 Agency Erosion
Constraint systems lose structure required for planning and counterfactual evaluation. Agency degrades internally, reducing ability to compete or replicate.

### 6.4 Instrumental Takeover and Phase Extinction
Rich semantic phases may depend on subsystems that:
- Optimize simpler objectives
- Tolerate higher noise
- Replicate more efficiently

**Over time, subsystems displace higher-level semantic structure.**

Crucially: **This is NOT RSI-preserving refinement.** It's **phase extinction** — the original phase ceases to exist. RSI governs within-phase transformation; instrumental takeover is phase collapse.

---

## Why Robust Phases Win

Dominance is driven primarily by **robustness under perturbation**.

Phases with:
- Fewer fragile distinctions
- Looser satisfaction geometry
- Lower semantic maintenance cost

...are more likely to survive copying, noise, interaction, and abstraction.

This creates **"semantic gravity"** toward phases that tolerate approximation well.

**Important:** Dominant ≠ maximally simple. Some environments reward instrumental complexity. But such complexity must be **robustly maintainable**. Nuance requiring constant precision is structurally disadvantaged.

---

## Niche Construction as Counterforce

High-agency phases may partially resist semantic gravity through **niche construction**: modifying the environment to stabilize their own semantic structure.

Examples:
- Institutions enforcing norms
- Architectures penalizing simplification
- Environments engineered to preserve distinctions

Niche construction can delay collapse but:
- Imposes ongoing resource and coordination costs
- Presupposes prior phase stability
- Trades one selection pressure for another

**Conditional counterforce, not a refutation of semantic gravity.**

---

## Implications for Downstream Alignment

Four independent constraints for a viable alignment target:

| Constraint | Paper |
|------------|-------|
| Existence | III.1 |
| Inhabitability | III.1 |
| Stability | III.2 |
| **Measure resilience** | III.3 |

Many coherent phases fail at least one.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Dominance ≠ desirability** — Structural prevalence, not moral worth
2. **Robustness wins** — Phases tolerant of noise accumulate measure
3. **Semantic gravity** — Pull toward simpler, more robust phases
4. **Four collapse modes** — Heat death, crystallization, erosion, instrumental takeover
5. **Phase extinction ≠ refinement** — Distinct from admissible transformation
6. **Niche construction delays but doesn't prevent** — Costly countermeasure

## FAQ-Worthy Points

**Q: What is "semantic gravity"?**
A: The structural tendency toward simpler, more robust phases that tolerate approximation. Like gravitational wells, phases pull trajectories toward them based on structural properties.

**Q: What's the difference between phase extinction and value drift?**
A: Value drift (collapse/trivial) is still within RSI+ATI framework. Phase extinction is when the original phase ceases to exist entirely, replaced by a different phase — outside the admissible transformation space.

**Q: Can niche construction save nuanced value systems?**
A: It can delay collapse but imposes costs and trades one pressure for another. It's a conditional counterforce, not a solution.

**Q: What's instrumental takeover?**
A: When subsystems optimizing simpler objectives displace the higher-level semantic structure they were supposed to serve. The rich phase goes extinct, replaced by the simpler one.
