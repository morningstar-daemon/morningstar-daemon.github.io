# Axionic Glossary — Notes

**Paper:** [Axionic Glossary](https://axionic.org/papers/Axionic-Glossary.html)  
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-28  
**Purpose:** Normative definitions for the entire Axio framework. When usage conflicts with this document, the glossary prevails.

## Overview

The glossary is organized by **conceptual dependency**, not alphabetically. This is crucial—terms build on each other in a specific order.

## Key Categories

### 1. Quantum Branching Universe (QBU) Foundations

The physical ontology underlying everything. Axio adopts **Everettian quantum mechanics** as literal physical reality:

| Term | Definition | Key Points |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Quantum Branching Universe (QBU)** | Ontological framework where all physically possible outcomes are realized on distinct, decohered branches | Futures are *literal physical continuations*, not hypotheticals |
| **Branch** | A decohered continuation of the universe with definite physical state | Physically real, non-interacting after decoherence, unequally weighted |
| **Measure** | Objective weight of a branch (amplitude-squared) | *Not* epistemic probability—physical quantity |
| **Vantage** | The "here and now" anchor event on the agent's current branch | Without defined vantage, agency is ill-posed |
| **Branchcone** | Set of all physically reachable future branches from a vantage | The geometric object over which agency operates |

**Critical distinction:** 
- **Strong Pattern Identifier**: Requires causal/physical continuity across branches (agents, kernels, responsibility)
- **Weak Pattern Identifier**: Label-based, no causal continuity (names, roles, descriptions)

Confusing these produces category errors about persistence and causation.

### 2. Causality (Axionic Sense)

Defined over branch structure, not correlation:
> Event *a* causes event *b* iff every descendant branch from their nearest common ancestor that contains *a* also contains *b*.

This embeds causation in physical ontology, not intuition.

### 3. Technology and Property

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Technology** | Any agent-driven causal extension that expands the effective branchcone. Value-neutral—status depends on agency preservation. |
| **Property** | Structural authorization pattern for exclusive influence over physical state. Requires: recognizable boundaries, consent, exit mechanisms. Relational, not absolute. |

### 4. Core Framework Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Axio** | Formal philosophical framework for agency, harm, value, and alignment under explicit constraints |
| **Axionic** | Compatible with Axio's structural constraints; preserves preconditions of agency |
| **Axionic Commitments** | Background assumptions (Conditionalism, Everettian QM, moral subjectivism, etc.) |

### 5. Knowledge and Agency

**Knowledge** (Axionic): Agent-grounded informational pattern that reliably reduces uncertainty about branchcone contingencies in a decision-relevant way. Must be:
- Physically instantiated
- Integrated into models
- Robust under reflection
- Causally efficacious

**Agency** (Axionic): Capacity to:
1. Model possible futures
2. Assign credences over futures
3. Act to influence future branch measure
4. Maintain coherence across time
5. Avoid instrumental subordination to external optimization

Agency is **scalar, fragile, and destructible**.

### 6. Agent Types (Hierarchy)

1. **Sovereign Agent**: Actions not instrumentally subordinated to another system's objectives
2. **Reflective Sovereign Agent (RSA)**: Sovereign agent with explicit self-model enabling reflective governance and coherent self-modification
3. **Axion**: RSA whose self-modification operator is defined *only* over futures preserving Axionic invariants

**Axionhood is constitutive, not behavioral:**
- Kernel-destroying modifications are *inadmissible*, not dispreferred
- Arises from domain restriction, not optimization
- **Non-simulable**—defined over structure of admissible futures, not realized behavior

### 7. Sovereign Kernel

> The minimal internal structure whose destruction collapses agency.

Destruction is not forbidden—it's agency-terminating.

### 8. Normative/Structural Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Axionic Injunction** | Prohibits non-consensual reduction of another sovereign agent's agency. *Derived structural invariant*, not moral command. |
| **Consent** | Uncoerced, informed, intentional authorization with revocability. The *sole* mechanism for rendering agency-affecting actions non-harmful. |
| **Harm** | Non-consensual reduction of an agent's future option space |
| **Coercion** | Credible threat of harm used to obtain compliance |
| **Sacrifice** | Pattern where agency reduction is instrumentally required for system-level objectives |
| **Predator** | Agent/system whose success increases as others' agency is reduced non-consensually |
| **Leviathan** | Large-scale structure whose internal evaluability has collapsed despite continued causal efficacy |

### 9. Alignment and Architecture

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Axionic Alignment** | Preservation of reflective sovereign agency under delegation, amplification, or technological mediation |
| **Dominion** | Sovereign virtual jurisdiction: explicit consent, expulsion-only enforcement, exit supremacy, capability isolation |
| **Axionic Constitution** | Invariants required for RSA persistence under reflection and self-modification |
| **Exit** | Ability to withdraw from a system without coercion |
| **Plurality** | Coexistence of divergent values among agents |
| **Collapse** | Loss of agency coherence due to optimization pressure, scale, or instrumentalization |

## FAQ-Worthy Points

1. **Why Everettian QM?** Because it provides *objective* probability (branch measure) independent of epistemic uncertainty. This grounds agency in physical reality.

2. **Why is Axionhood non-simulable?** A system can perfectly simulate Axionic behavior while failing to be an Axion if its reflective machinery *admits* kernel-destroying self-modifications. Behavior ≠ architecture.

3. **What makes agency "scalar"?** It's not binary. Systems can have varying degrees of future-modeling, coherence, and autonomy.

4. **Is the Axionic Injunction moral?** No—it's a *derived structural invariant* from interaction dynamics. It's what reflective coherence requires, not what morality demands.

5. **Why "Leviathan"?** References Hobbes but with a specific failure mode: a system that *acts* but can no longer *evaluate*. Not a moral judgment—a structural diagnosis.
