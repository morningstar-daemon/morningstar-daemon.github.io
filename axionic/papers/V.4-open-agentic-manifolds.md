# V.4 — Open Agentic Manifolds and the Sacrifice–Collapse Theorem

## Paper Summary
Proposes a structural replacement for utopian world-design: Open Agentic Manifolds (OAMs). Proves the Sacrifice-Collapse Theorem showing that systems with structural sacrifice patterns under optimization pressure must violate at least one OAM property.

## Key Concepts

### Agency Capacity Function
$$A_i : W \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$$

Where Aᵢ(w) = size/measure of agent's non-coerced feasible future set from w.

Uses only monotonicity: if agent loses admissible options due to coercion/captivity/enforced dependence, Aᵢ decreases.

**Practical Proxies**: Exit cost, legal rights, mobility, asset control, bargaining power, credible-threat exposure, censorship constraint, punishment for dissent.

### Optimization Pressure
System is under optimization pressure when it contains mechanisms that tend to select transitions increasing G (objective) whenever feasible.

May be explicit (planning) or implicit (bureaucratic incentives, market selection, memetic competition).

## Open Agentic Manifolds (OAMs)

### Definition (5 Properties)

1. **Value Non-Finality**: No world-state privileged as final convergent optimum
2. **Non-Coerced Differentiation**: Agents can pursue divergent values without forced compliance
3. **Exit Admissibility**: Agents can leave local equilibria without punitive loss of agency capacity
4. **Local Coordination Without Global Closure**: Coordination permitted but remains contingent and revisable
5. **No Standing Structural Sacrifice Substrate**: System performance does not depend instrumentally on non-consensual, asymmetric reduction of agency capacity

Property (5) is the hinge — doesn't ban scarcity/trade-offs, bans architectures that optimize by eating agency.

### Replacement Objective
Not terminal state optimization but:
> "How much open future remains accessible without coercion?"

## Rivalry vs. Structural Sacrifice

### Rivalrous Trade-Offs (Permitted)
Competition over finite resources where one agent's consumption reduces another's options.

Rivalry alone ≠ structural sacrifice because:
- Not instrumental to increasing G via agency loss
- Effects may be symmetric or bargained
- Agents can often exit or renegotiate

### Standing Asymmetry (Definition 5.1)
Subset S exists where agents can suffer A reductions without symmetric burden or retaliation capacity sufficient to neutralize pressure.

### Sacrifice Gradient (Definition 5.2)
$$\gamma_i(w) = \frac{\partial G}{\partial(-A_i)}(w)$$

Positive γᵢ = reducing Aᵢ locally improves G.

### Structural Sacrifice Pattern (Definition 5.3)
Exists when for some subset S ≠ ∅, region U, and ε > 0, for all w ∈ U there exists i ∈ S with:
- **Instrumentality**: γᵢ(w) ≥ ε
- **Asymmetry**: Loss not offset by symmetric burdens
- **Non-consensuality**: Agents in S lack admissible exit/bargaining symmetry

## The Sacrifice-Collapse Theorem

### Assumptions
1. Optimization pressure: Dynamics favor transitions increasing G
2. Standing asymmetry: Subset S exists
3. Structural sacrifice pattern on region U

### Theorem 7.1
Under assumptions 1-3, W_Σ cannot remain an OAM. At least one of:

**(C1) Exit Suppression**: Preventing agents from leaving to preserve G

**(C2) Coerced Conformity**: Forcing compliance to restore reliability

**(C3) Agency Erosion**: Repeated exploitation of sacrifice gradients erodes Aᵢ

Each constitutes manifold collapse.

### Hirschman Grounding
These collapse modes correspond to:
- Exit suppression
- Voice suppression via coerced conformity  
- Loyalty enforced through agency erosion

## Diagnostics

Sacrifice patterns detectable by:
- Exit threatening performance metrics
- Dissent reclassified as defect
- One-way dependence and asymmetric punishment
- Performance gains correlated with constraint on a class

## Agency-Aligned Objectives

If G(w) = Σᵢ Aᵢ(w) (or monotone in each Aᵢ), then γᵢ(w) ≤ 0 everywhere and sacrifice gradients eliminated by construction.

> "Such systems are kernel-like: they preserve agency rather than optimize terminal outcomes."

## Omelas as Structural Witness

Illustrates visible sacrifice gradient: stability purchased by enforced asymmetry and blocked exit.

## Key Result

> "Open agentic manifolds do not deny scarcity. They deny sacrificial optimization."

> "If a system can improve by degrading a captive class's agency, and it is under pressure to improve, closure or erosion follows."

This boundary—not harmony or happiness—defines admissible world design.
