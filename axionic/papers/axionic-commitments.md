# The Axionic Commitments — Notes

**Paper:** [The Axionic Commitments](https://axionic.org/papers/Axionic-Commitments.html)  
**Authors:** David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2  
**Date:** 2025.12.23  
**Purpose:** Specifies the explicit presuppositions of Axionic Agency. These are **background conditions**, not derived results.

## Core Function

This document serves as a **typing discipline** for the entire framework. It makes implicit assumptions explicit so that:
1. Technical work can proceed without re-litigating metaphysics
2. Disagreement can be properly located (outside vs. inside the framework)
3. All claims are explicitly **conditional**

> "Rejecting any commitment does not refute the framework; it places the rejecting position outside its domain of applicability."

## The Commitments

### 1. Epistemic Commitments

#### 1.1 Conditionalism

> "All truth claims, evaluations, and interpretations are conditional on background structure."

**Key implications:**
- No unconditional truth claims within the framework
- Meaning, reference, and evaluation are *always* relative to interpretive context
- All statements are of the form: "Given X, Y holds"
- **Unconditional assertions are ill-typed**

This doesn't deny facts exist—it specifies the framework's relationship to claims.

#### 1.2 Semantic Interpretation Precedes Evaluation

> "No evaluative claim can be made without an interpretive frame that renders the relevant entities, states, and transitions intelligible."

**Consequences:**
- Evaluation without interpretation is *undefined*
- Value disagreements often reduce to interpretation disagreements
- Agency-relative quantities presuppose interpretability of action, state, and consequence

This grounds the distinction between **authored** and **non-authored** transitions.

### 2. Physical Commitments

#### 2.1 Everettian Quantum Mechanics

The framework presupposes **unitary QM without collapse** (Many-Worlds):
- Quantum evolution is deterministic at the universal wavefunction level
- Branching corresponds to decohered outcomes
- No assumption of collapse or privileged outcomes

#### 2.2 Objective Probability as Measure

> "Objective probability is identified with branch measure."

**Not** long-run frequency, **not** subjective belief—a *physical quantity* (amplitude-squared).

This is referred to as **Measure** throughout the framework.

Properties:
- Objective
- Non-epistemic
- Independent of any agent's beliefs

#### 2.3 Counterfactuals as Physical Branches

Counterfactuals are **not** abstract modal constructs. They refer to physically realized alternative branches that differ with respect to the interpreted action/transition.

This grounds counterfactual evaluation in **physical structure and objective measure**, not stipulated possible-world semantics.

---

### 3. Probabilistic Commitments

#### 3.1 Credence as Epistemic Uncertainty

The framework adopts **Bayesian credence**:
- Reflects agent's state of knowledge/ignorance about which branch it occupies
- Does *not* determine objective chance
- Does *not* alter physical measure

**Critical distinction:**

| Quantity | Type | Scope |
|----------|------|-------|
| Measure | Ontic/physical | Objective, branch weight |
| Credence | Epistemic | Agent-relative, uncertainty |

> "Conflating the two is a category error within the framework."

### 4. Value-Theoretic Commitments

#### 4.1 Moral Subjectivism

> "Value is treated as agent-relative and internally grounded."

No appeal to:
- Objective moral facts
- Universal value functions
- Externally privileged ethical standards

**Normative claims within Axio are structural, not moral.** They concern coherence, authorship, and agency preservation—not goodness, justice, or obligation.

#### 4.2 No Outcome Guarantees

The framework explicitly does **not** encode guarantees regarding:
- Welfare
- Benevolence
- Human survival
- Desirable outcomes

Any such guarantees must be derived downstream under additional assumptions.

> "Outcome guarantees are not constitutive of agency and are therefore excluded from the core theory."

---

### 5. Agency-Theoretic Commitments

#### 5.1 Agency as Authorship

> "An agent is not merely a system that produces behavior, but one that can meaningfully author transitions between states according to an internal evaluative structure."

Transitions that violate constitutive constraints are *not actions* within the framework.

#### 5.2 Harm as Agency Reduction

Harm is defined **structurally**:

> "Reduction of agency capacity"

**Not** suffering, displeasure, preference frustration, or moral wrongness. Loss of ability to act, choose, or preserve standing as an agent.

This definition is **value-neutral** and presupposes no particular welfare conception.

#### 5.3 Coercion as Credible Threat of Harm

> "The use of a credible threat of harm to obtain compliance."

Persuasion, influence, and incentive-shaping do **not** constitute coercion unless backed by credible threat of agency reduction.

---

## Document Hierarchy

The structural relationship between core documents:

```
Axionic Commitments → Background conditions for intelligible agency
       ↓
Axionic Agency → Constitutive conditions for RSAs under those commitments
       ↓
Axionic Constitution → Constraints on transitions that preserve sovereign agency
       ↓
Alignment → Operates downstream of all above layers
```

Each layer presupposes the previous. None can collapse into others without coherence loss.

## FAQ-Worthy Points

1. **Is this relativism?** No. Conditionalism specifies that *claims within the framework* are conditional. It doesn't deny facts—it clarifies the framework's relationship to making claims.

2. **Why moral subjectivism?** Because the framework needs to work without assuming any particular moral view. Structural constraints apply regardless of what values an agent holds.

3. **Why no safety guarantees?** Because those are downstream concerns. The framework defines what agency *is*, not what it *should do*. Any safety properties must be derived from agent-relative values under additional assumptions.

4. **What happens if I reject a commitment?** You're outside the framework's domain of applicability. The framework doesn't apply to you, and that's fine—it's not claiming universality.

5. **Why is this document necessary?** To prevent endless re-litigation of metaphysical assumptions during technical work. If we agree on commitments, we can proceed to derive consequences.
