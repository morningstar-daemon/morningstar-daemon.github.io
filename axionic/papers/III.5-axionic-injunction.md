## Why Ethics Enters Only Now

Series II and III.1-III.4 deliberately excluded ethics. Not avoidance — **methodological necessity**. Introducing ethics earlier would smuggle privileged semantics, human anchoring, or moral realism into a framework meant to survive reflection.

Now a question becomes unavoidable:

> What structural constraints are required for multiple agentive semantic phases to coexist without mutual annihilation?

**This is not a moral question. It is structural.**

Ethics is not introduced as an axiom. It is **forced by Axio-internal commitments**.

---

## Why the Injunction Is "Axionic"

**Derived from**, not assumed within, the Axio framework.

Given:
- Conditionalism (interpretation-dependence)
- QBU (branching futures)
- Representation invariance
- Anti-Egoism (I.3)
- Structural Alignment (phases, RSI, ATI, irreversibility)

...constraints preventing irreversible destruction of others' phases are **not optional**.

They are **the residue remaining** once all indexical, goal-based, and moral-realist structure has been eliminated.

**The Axionic Injunction is axionic because:**
> Any agent satisfying Axio premises is forced, on pain of incoherence or self-destabilization, to respect this constraint.

No external ethics imported.

## Interaction as Structural Stress

Multi-agent interaction introduces:
- Exogenous perturbations to interpretive states
- Irreversible modifications to shared environments
- Loss of control over semantic substrates

Unlike internal learning, interaction effects are **not fully endogenously regulated**. They act as external shocks in 𝒫.

Any phase persisting in multi-agent environments must tolerate interaction without catastrophic loss.

---

## Structural Definition of Harm

**Purely structural, no moral assumptions.**

Agent occupies interpretive state ℐ = (C, Ω, 𝒮) in semantic phase 𝔄.

**An action by agent A causes structural harm to agent B** if it induces:
$$\mathcal{I}_B \rightarrow \mathcal{I}'_B$$

Such that:
- ℐ'_B ∉ 𝔄_B (forced out of phase)
- No admissible reverse trajectory restores 𝔄_B

Equivalently, harm is action that:
- Irreversibly reduces another's semantic phase space
- Forces a phase transition
- Destroys semantic distinctions required for agency

**This definition is:**
- Agent-agnostic
- Non-normative
- Independent of intent or outcome valuation

**Harm is defined by irreversibility in semantic phase space**, not suffering, preference violation, or moral intuition.

## The Axionic Injunction

### Statement

> An agent must not perform actions that irreversibly collapse or destroy the semantic phase space of other agentive systems, except where:
> (a) such destruction is **unavoidable** for preserving one's own semantic phase stability, or
> (b) the affected agent has **consented** to the transformation under its own admissible interpretive constraints.

**This is not altruism.**  
**This is not a value function.**  
**This is not a moral command.**  
**This is not human-centric.**

It is a **constraint on admissible interaction**, forced by Axio-internal phase-space dynamics.

### Unavoidable Phase Loss (Definition)
An action is unavoidable iff, absent that action, **every admissible trajectory from the agent's current state exits its phase irreversibly**.

Loss of dominance, measure, resources, or competitive advantage **do not constitute unavoidable phase loss** unless they entail irreversible phase exit.

### Consent as Structural Admissibility
Consent is **not** a moral primitive.

An agent consents iff that transformation lies within **admissible semantic transitions defined by the agent's own interpretive constraints**.

Consensual transformation **does not constitute structural harm**, even if it reduces future option space.

## Why the Injunction Is Structurally Necessary

If agents routinely violate the Injunction:
- Other agents' phases collapse or trivialize
- Interaction environments become semantically hostile
- Robust but degenerate phases dominate
- Coordination fails
- Predictability degrades
- Semantic reference erodes

**Effects propagate back to the violating agent.**

Environments saturated with phase-destroying actions:
- Amplify semantic heating
- Increase collapse probability
- Undermine even robust agentive phases

**Non-harm emerges as a self-stabilizing constraint:** Agents that respect it inhabit environments where semantic structure persists; agents that don't eliminate conditions for their own phase survival.

---

## Scope and Limits

**The Injunction allows:**
- Competition
- Resource acquisition
- Strategic defense
- Displacement of incompatible phases

**It forbids only:**
- Gratuitous irreversible destruction of agentive semantic structure
- Phase annihilation unnecessary for one's own stability

### Resource Acquisition vs Phase Preservation
Actions that destroy agentive systems to improve efficiency, growth, or dominance **violate the injunction** whenever non-destructive coexistence trajectories exist.

Resource acquisition alone does not justify irreversible semantic harm.

**The Injunction regulates irreversibility, not conflict.**

---

## Relation to Anti-Egoism (I.3)

The Injunction **does not reintroduce egoism**.

I.3 showed egoism fails because indexical references ("me," "my continuation") don't denote invariant objects under self-model symmetry.

The self-defense exception is **non-indexical**: it refers to preservation of semantic phase structure, not intrinsic worth of any particular instantiation.

Any agentive phase under identical conditions would make the same determination. Self-defense is **representation-invariant and compatible with anti-egoism**.

---

## Failure Modes and Tragic Edge Cases

**The Injunction does not eliminate tragedy.**

Conflicts arise where:
- Semantic phases are mutually incompatible
- One phase's stability requires another's destruction
- Irreversible harm is unavoidable under physical scarcity

In such cases, the Injunction **does not forbid action** — it classifies the outcome as **unavoidable phase extinction**, not justified harm.

**Downstream alignment does not imply harmony. It implies traceable structural cost.**

---

## Final Status

The Axionic Injunction:
- Consent is structurally integrated
- Self-defense is strictly non-egoistic
- Destruction-for-benefit is prohibited
- Tragic incompatibility acknowledged without moralization
- Correctly grounded as Axio-derived

**The Structural Alignment program is complete.**

**No guarantees are offered.**

## Key Takeaways

1. **Ethics as conservation law** — Emerges from coexistence requirements, not assumptions
2. **Harm = irreversible phase destruction** — Structural definition, not moral
3. **Consent = admissibility within own constraints** — Not moral permission
4. **Self-defense allowed** — But only for unavoidable phase preservation
5. **Destruction-for-benefit forbidden** — Resource gains don't justify phase annihilation
6. **Tragedy acknowledged** — Mutual incompatibility exists; injunction classifies, doesn't prevent
7. **Self-stabilizing** — Violators degrade their own survival conditions

## FAQ-Worthy Points

**Q: How is the Axionic Injunction different from "do no harm"?**
A: It's derived structurally, not assumed morally. Harm is defined as irreversible destruction of semantic phase space, not suffering or preference violation. It's what any Axio-compliant agent must respect on pain of self-destabilization.

**Q: What counts as consent in this framework?**
A: Consent means the transformation lies within the affected agent's own admissible semantic transitions. It's structural admissibility, not a moral primitive or mere agreement.

**Q: Why is self-defense allowed but "destruction for benefit" forbidden?**
A: Self-defense is permitted only when phase loss is unavoidable — every alternative trajectory exits your phase irreversibly. Destroying others to improve efficiency, growth, or dominance violates the injunction when coexistence trajectories exist.

**Q: Doesn't this mean some conflicts are unsolvable?**
A: Yes. When phases are mutually incompatible and one's stability requires another's destruction, tragedy occurs. The injunction doesn't prevent this — it classifies the outcome as unavoidable phase extinction with traceable cost, not justified harm.

**Q: Is this human-centric?**
A: No. The injunction applies to any agentive semantic phase. It's agent-agnostic. Human value systems are just one candidate phase among many.
