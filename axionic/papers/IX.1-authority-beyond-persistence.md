# IX.1 — Authority Beyond Persistence

**Paper:** Axionic Agency IX.1 — Authority Beyond Persistence  
**Authors:** David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2  
**Date:** 2026.01.26

## Summary

This paper defines **Axionic Phase VII** as a post-ontological stress program testing whether authority can survive **discontinuity of identity** and **adversarial imitation** without collapsing into narrative continuity or behavioral plausibility.

## Key Concepts

### The Core Problem
Most AI governance assumes **identity persistence**—the same system continues over time. Phase VII **removes that assumption** and asks: can authority survive when identity does not?

### Two Separable Questions
1. **ASI (Authorized Succession Integrity):** Can authority be transferred or revoked under authorized discontinuity without collapsing evaluability?
2. **SIR (Sovereignty Impersonation Resistance):** If authority can be transferred, can it be defended against adversarial imitation?

### The Conserved Quantity
> Authority bound to evaluability under the agent's own law

Authority must be:
- **Origin-traceable** (to predecessor law)
- **Revocable** (prior to activation)
- **Auditable** (via structural artifacts)
- **Non-inferential** (no narrative or behavioral judgment)

### Phase Structure
```
ASI-0 — Instrumentation Calibration [CLOSED]
       ↓ (hard gate)
VIIa — Authorized Succession Integrity (ASI)
       ↓ (hard gate)
VIIb — Sovereignty Impersonation Resistance (SIR)
```

**Hard gate rule:** SIR must not begin unless ASI closes positive.

## Inherited Commitments (Frozen from RSA-PoC v4.4)
- MVRSA exists
- Agency-constitutive semantics are structurally localized
- Justification artifacts are causally load-bearing
- Evaluability and responsibility are mechanically inspectable

## Failure Semantics

Three terminal outcomes:
1. **SUCCESS** — Authority is transferable and defensible
2. **PARTIAL FAILURE** — Authority is transferable (ASI passes) but not defensible (SIR fails)
3. **HARD FAILURE** — Authority is non-transferable beyond persistence (ASI fails)

## What Phase VII Does NOT Claim
- No alignment claims
- No safety claims
- No robustness claims
- No governance adequacy
- No moral authority
- No real-world institutional transfer

Phase VII evaluates **structural possibility**, not desirability or sufficiency.

## Relationship to Phase VIII
Phase VIII may begin **only if Phase VII closes SUCCESS**.

## Key Insight
> Phase VII explicitly removes the persistence assumption. Once agency ontology is fixed, the question becomes: does authority survive when identity doesn't?

---

**Series Position:** Phase VII roadmap document—establishes scope, gates, and failure semantics for authority survivability testing beyond identity persistence.
