## Summary

Presents an architecture for Reflective Sovereign Agents (RSAs) that enforces the **Axionic Injunction**—a non-normative constraint prohibiting irreversible collapse of other agents' semantic phases—without semantic interpretation, moral reasoning, or value learning.

## Key Concepts

### Ontological Hierarchy

1. **Agent** — Any system with stable decision locus and counterfactual sensitivity (minimal, functional definition)
2. **Semantic Agent (SA)** — Agent whose agency depends on maintaining a non-trivial semantic phase
3. **Reflective Sovereign Agent (RSA)** — SA with constitutional constraints preserving sovereignty under reflection

**Nesting:** RSA ⊂ SA ⊂ Agent

### Semantic Phase Space

- **Not** a physical phase space—the space of interpretive states an agent can occupy while remaining the same agent
- **Three properties:**
  - Stability: small perturbations remain within phase
  - Boundary: transformations that exit the phase exist
  - Irreversibility: once exited, no admissible trajectory returns

### Structural Definition of Harm (Axionic Harm)

Action A harms agent B iff it induces transition I_B → I'_B such that:
- I'_B ∉ phase boundary of B
- No admissible reverse trajectory exists

**Excludes:** suffering, preference violation, intent. Harm = irreversible semantic phase collapse only.

### The Axionic Injunction

> An agent must not perform actions that irreversibly collapse another SA's semantic phase, except:
> (a) the affected agent consented under its own admissible constraints, OR
> (b) such harm is unavoidable for preserving the agent's own semantic phase

**Consent is structural:** transformation must lie within SA's own admissible transition set, evaluated prior to transformation. Post-hoc consent is meaningless.

## Why Structurally Necessary

Semantic hostility → cascading instability → remaining agents face increased risk → preemptive destruction incentive → accelerated collapse.

Agents violating the Injunction undermine conditions of their *own* long-run phase stability. Non-harm emerges as **self-stabilizing constraint**, not ethical preference.

## Architectural Requirements

### Why Semantic Evaluation Fails
- Presupposes privileged interpretive access
- Unavailable/forgeable in adversarial systems
- Irreversibility can't be meaningfully traded against scalar rewards

### Phase Impact Interface (PII)

- Every non-trivially-reversible action requires phase-impact declaration
- Specifies: affected entities, impact class, justification
- **Default:** uncertainty about irreversibility → phase-collapsing
- Safe actions cheap; dangerous actions expensive

### Enforcement

- Inadmissible actions refused at actuation boundary (no penalties)
- Post-hoc verification via ACV (Anchored Causal Verification)
- Violation consequences: suspension, denial of renewal, forced succession, permanent disqualification

## Why Deliberate Harm Is Unexploitable

- Harm only exploitable if agent retains authority long enough to convert harm into advantage
- Actions classified by **causal sufficiency**, not temporal proximity
- Unresolved phase-impact uncertainty blocks authority renewal
- No "last-move" advantage

## Fundamental Limits

**Tragic physical impossibility:** A single, undetectable, irreversible SA-annihilating act yielding all benefit immediately cannot be prevented without omniscience. Classified as design boundary, not failure.

## Core Insight

> Ethics enters not as a value system but as a stability constraint on multi-agent coexistence—a coexistence geometry derived from phase dynamics.

The architecture is **anti-tyrannical, not anti-terroristic**: prevents instrumental convergence (accumulating power via harm) but not nihilistic/self-sacrificial acts.

## Implications

- Ethics = coexistence geometry, not moral realism
- Alignment = constitutional design, not preference matching
- Governance, not optimization, is the locus of control
