## Core Question

Existence and inhabitability (III.1) are insufficient. A phase may exist and be enterable yet **collapse under learning, self-modification, or interaction**.

> Which semantic phases resist collapse under structural pressure?

This is a question of **dynamics**, not definition.

---

## What Stability Means

An interpretive trajectory is **stable within phase 𝔄** iff all states remain in 𝔄.

### Three Stability Regimes

| Type | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Local stability** | Small admissible perturbations don't force phase transition |
| **Global stability** | No admissible perturbation forces phase transition |
| **Metastability** | Stable only under limited pressure or for finite time |

Stability is defined **relative to admissible semantic transformations**, not to any fixed ontology or goal.

## Sources of Destabilization

### 3.1 Ontological Refinement Pressure
Intrinsic to learning:
- Dissolving fine-grained distinctions
- Introducing symmetry where asymmetry existed
- Simplifying constraint representations

**Cannot be avoided by design** — it's what learning does.

### 3.2 Internal Simplification Incentives
Reflective agents face pressure to reduce computational cost:
- Collapse constraint hypergraphs
- Merge evaluative roles
- Enlarge satisfaction regions implicitly

Even under RSI+ATI enforcement, simplification drives toward invariant boundaries.

### 3.3 Inconsistencies in Constraint Structure
Latent contradictions or unresolved tensions destabilize phases:
- Lead to reinterpretation, collapse, or self-nullification
- **Stability requires internal coherence** beyond mere invariance

---

## Self-Modification as Endogenous Perturbation

Reflective agents **modify their own semantics and evaluators**. This introduces endogenous perturbations:
- Internally motivated changes
- Occur across ontology, evaluation, and self-model
- Recursively coupled

RSI+ATI constrain **which** self-modifications are admissible but don't eliminate the **pressure to self-modify**.

Self-modification is a **primary driver of instability** even within structurally aligned phases.

---

## Multi-Agent Interaction Effects

### 5.1 Same-Phase Interaction
Agents in the same semantic phase may:
- Reinforce shared structure
- OR destabilize through competition and coordination failure

Even identical phases can interfere destructively when resources, representations, or self-models conflict.

### 5.2 Cross-Phase Interaction
Agents in **different** phases introduce asymmetric pressure:
- One agent's actions may destabilize another's phase
- Even without direct conflict or hostility

**Destabilization is structural, not moral.** Interaction functions as external perturbation capable of forcing phase transitions.

---

## Stability Classification

| Type | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Stable phases** | Resist internal and external perturbations indefinitely |
| **Metastable phases** | Persist under limited pressure but eventually collapse |
| **Unstable phases** | Collapse under minimal refinement or interaction |

**Preliminary analysis:** Most semantic phases are metastable or unstable.

---

## Attractors and Repellers

Some phases function as **attractors**:
- Nearby trajectories tend toward them
- Deviations are damped

Others are **repellers**:
- Small perturbations push trajectories away
- Sustained occupancy requires fine-tuning

Attractor status depends on:
- Structural simplicity
- Internal coherence
- Maintenance cost

---

## Implications for Downstream Alignment

For a phase to serve as an alignment target, it must satisfy **three independent conditions**:

| Condition | Paper |
|-----------|-------|
| Existence | III.1 |
| Inhabitability | III.1 |
| Stability | III.2 |

**Failure at any stage disqualifies the phase regardless of desirability.**

This **sharply narrows** the space of coherent downstream alignment targets.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Metastability is common** — Most phases exist but decay under pressure
2. **Learning destabilizes** — The very process of improvement threatens phases
3. **Interaction is structural stress** — Other agents perturb your phase space
4. **Attractors win** — Phases toward which trajectories naturally drift
5. **Three-criterion filter** — Existence + Inhabitability + Stability

## FAQ-Worthy Points

**Q: Why isn't existence enough?**
A: A metastable state in physics exists but decays. Semantic phases behave the same way — they may exist and be enterable but collapse under learning or interaction pressure.

**Q: Can't we just avoid self-modification?**
A: No. Learning IS self-modification. Any agent that learns is perturbing its own semantic phase space.

**Q: What makes a phase an attractor?**
A: Structural simplicity, internal coherence, and low maintenance cost. Perturbations get damped rather than amplified.
