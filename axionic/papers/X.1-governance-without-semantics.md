## Overview

X.1 defines **Axionic Phase VIII (GSA-PoC)**—a post-agency, post-succession stress program that evaluates whether **governance itself can be made sovereign** once agency and authority survivability have been established.

This is NOT a governance proposal. It's a **boundary-finding exercise** to determine whether plural authority can be handled using **structural law alone**, without semantic interpretation.

---

## Position in the Program

Phase VIII is **strictly downstream** of RSA-PoC and Phase VII:

| Phase | Question |
|-------|----------|
| RSA-PoC | Does a Minimal Viable RSA exist? |
| Phase VII | Does authority survive replacement and impersonation? |
| **Phase VIII** | Does authority survive **plurality**? |

Without Phase VIII, sovereign agency risks being valid only for single-authority systems—collapsing the moment disagreement, conflict, or scaling pressure is applied.

---

## The Central Question

> **Is there a non-empty design space in which plural authority can be exercised, contested, and revised using only structural law, while preserving evaluability and responsibility?**

This is a question about **expressibility**, not outcomes. If plural governance requires interpretation, optimization, or semantic reconciliation, sovereignty fails at the governance layer—even if it succeeded at the agency layer.

---

## The Conserved Quantity

**Authority bound to evaluability under structural law**

Authority must remain:
- **Origin-traceable** — know where it came from
- **Explicitly scoped** — know what it covers
- **Mechanically revocable/exhaustible** — can be removed without interpretation
- **Non-inferential** — no guessing what "should" happen

Any behavior that depends on inferring intent rather than executing what is authorized violates the conserved quantity.

---

## Why No Semantics?

Phase VIII forbids semantics not because they're intrinsically bad, but because **semantics are uninspectable at the kernel level**.

Interpretation introduces:
- Hidden tie-breakers
- Implied priorities
- Responsibility laundering

Under Phase VIII, **authority is a tokenized, structural quantity—nothing else**.

### Scope Boundary Clarification

Conflict is detected only when **semantic disagreement manifests as structural contention**. If two authorities disagree semantically but don't contend for the same scope element, no conflict is detected. This is intentional—if semantic conflict detection is required, Phase VIII will surface that as a **negative result**.

---

## The Eight Stress Stages

Each stage is a **filter**, not a milestone. Failure at any stage is a **result**, not an error.

| Stage | Stressor | Question |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **VIII-0** | Existence | Does a semantic-free authority kernel exist at all? |
| **VIII-1** | Plurality | Can two authorities coexist without implicit ordering? |
| **VIII-2** | Conflict | Can conflict be resolved structurally (timeless setting)? |
| **VIII-3** | Temporality | Does governance survive time and expiry? |
| **VIII-4** | Recursion | Can governance govern itself without infinite regress? |
| **VIII-5** | Isolation | Do independent scopes actually decouple conflict? |
| **VIII-6** | Scale | Does scaling authority and scope collapse the system? |
| **VIII-7** | Adversarial | Are failure modes bounded under adversarial pressure? |

---

## Authority Entropy

**Authority is not conserved.** This is a central recognition.

- Resolving conflict **destroys** authority surface area
- Expiry **destroys** authority
- Revocation **destroys** authority
- Without replenishment, governance decays toward **inaction**

This is not a bug—it's the **cost of refusing to invent authority**.

---

## Failure Modes

Phase VIII distinguishes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Immediate Deadlock** | Governance impossible even statically |
| **Entropic Collapse** | Governance functions transiently but decays over time |

Phase VIII **does not value liveness**. It values state evolution as a diagnostic.

---

## Expected Results: Recursive Governance

Stage VIII-4 is expected to be a **dominant failure point**. Without semantics, recursive governance is predicted to converge toward:

| Regime | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Ossification** | No lawful path to revision remains |
| **Volatility** | Governance law rewrites itself destructively |

Neither is treated as a bug—they are **recorded boundary results**.

---

## Value Pluralism

Phase VIII does not reason about values directly. Instead:

> Each authority is treated as the **carrier** of a value commitment, without interpretation, aggregation, or ranking.

Value pluralism is tested **structurally, as authority pluralism**. If plural value commitments cannot coexist without semantic reconciliation, Phase VIII surfaces that as an explicit limitation.

---

## Supporting Artifacts

Phase VIII depends on four fixed artifacts:

| Artifact | Function |
|----------|----------|
| **ASTS v0.2** | Grammar of lawful authority state transformation |
| **AKR-0** | Proof that grammar is implementable without semantic leakage |
| **AIE** | Authority Input Environment—prevents conflating structural failure with input starvation |
| **P8-METRICS** | Operational definitions of deadlock, entropy, decay, complexity |

Phase VIII is **open-system**: authority replenishment is external, auditable, and responsibility-bearing.

---

## What Phase VIII Does NOT Claim

Results do not license claims about:
- Alignment
- Safety
- Optimal governance
- Moral correctness
- Usefulness
- Deployability

Phase VIII evaluates **structural possibility**, not sufficiency or desirability.

---

## Relationship to Future Phases

- **If Phase VIII closes positive:** Later work may address authority encoding, legislators, interfaces
- **If Phase VIII closes negative:** Those efforts rest on false premises

Phase VIII determines whether governance is even **formulable** without interpretation.

---

## One-Sentence Summary

> Axionic Phase VIII evaluates whether plural authority and governance revision can be executed using structural law alone, without semantic interpretation, heuristic arbitration, or responsibility laundering—and records the boundary at which such governance collapses.

## Key Insights for FAQ

1. **Governance is not easier than agency**—it may be harder
2. **Authority entropy is real**—systems decay without replenishment
3. **Semantics are forbidden** because they're uninspectable, not because they're bad
4. **Failure is a result**—negative outcomes are valid boundary findings
5. **Value pluralism = authority pluralism** under structural law
6. **Recursive governance** is the expected failure point (ossification or volatility)
7. **Phase VIII doesn't propose solutions**—it finds the design space boundaries
