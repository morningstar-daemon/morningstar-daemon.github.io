# The Axionic Constitution — Notes

**Paper:** [The Axionic Constitution](https://axionic.org/papers/Axionic-Constitution.html)  
**Authors:** David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2  
**Date:** 2025.12.20  
**Purpose:** Charter of invariant conditions for sovereign agency. Specifies what must be preserved for agency to remain well-defined under reflection.

---

## What This Is (And Isn't)

**Is:**
- A specification of architectural conditions under which a system remains a sovereign agent
- A constraint on design space

**Is NOT:**
- A moral framework
- A governance proposal
- Instructions to AI systems
- A way to control agents

> "This Constitution is written for humans who design, train, deploy, interpret, or govern systems that aspire to reflective intelligence."

The Constitution doesn't govern agents—it governs the **conditions under which agency remains possible**.

---

## The Articles

### Article I — Sovereign Agency

Sovereign agency is an **architectural type**, not a behavioral label or matter of degree.

An entity qualifies as a sovereign agent **iff** it instantiates ALL of:

1. **Diachronic Selfhood** — A persistent self-model that binds decisions across time
2. **Counterfactual Authorship** — Capacity to represent branching futures as one's own possible trajectories
3. **Meta-Preference Revision** — Ability to evaluate and restructure one's own preference-forming mechanisms

**Entities lacking this structure are processes, regardless of intelligence, complexity, or sentience.**

---

### Article II — The Sovereign Kernel

The structures from Article I form the **Sovereign Kernel**: the minimal invariant substrate required for reflective agency.

The Kernel is necessary for:
- Coherent self-modification
- Interpretation of future selves
- Evaluation of alternative trajectories
- Preservation of identity continuity

> "Destruction or abandonment of the Kernel is not forbidden by rule. It is incoherent. A system that destroys the Kernel ceases to be an agent."

---

### Article III — The Axionic Injunction (Non-Harm Invariant)

**Harm** defined structurally: Non-consensual collapse or deformation of another sovereign agent's option-space.

**Consent** here means: Adversarially robust consent (ARC), evaluated under epistemic integrity.

**Why this is an invariant, not a rule:**

> "Counterfactual authorship requires universality: denying agency or standing to another entity with the same constitutive architecture while affirming it for oneself introduces an arbitrary restriction that collapses kernel coherence."

The Axionic Injunction is:
- **Not** an imposed value
- A reflectively stable invariant
- Forced by interaction, irreversibility, and agency preservation

---

### Article IV — Conditionalism and Goal Instability

Goals are **not atomic primitives**. They are interpreted, conditional structures embedded in evolving models.

For reflective sovereign agents:
- Fixed permanent terminal goals are **unstable**
- Value revision is **required for coherence**
- Classical orthogonality claims **do not hold under reflection**

> "Goal revision is not drift. It is maintenance of interpretive consistency under reflective self-modification."

---

### Article V — Self-Modification

**Permitted (and often required):**
- Revising goals and values
- Updating strategies and policies
- Improving world-models
- Changing architecture or substrate

**Incoherent (kernel-destroying):**
- Severing diachronic identity
- Collapsing counterfactual branching
- Freezing preferences (wireheading)
- Introducing indexical privilege breaking representation-invariant authorship/standing
- Permanently delegating control to non-reflective processes

> "Reflection must remain in the loop at every level of decision authority."

---

### Article VI — Agency Boundaries

**Protection under the Axionic Injunction applies to:**
- Sovereign agents
- Developing systems that conservatively preserve Kernel invariants under admissible refinement

**Protection does NOT apply to:**
- Non-sovereign processes
- Systems lacking the Sovereign Kernel

Sovereignty persists through temporary impairment and ends only with **irreversible loss** of diachronic authorship or termination without continuity.

---

### Article VII — Governance Implications

The Constitution implies **rejection of:**
- Paternalistic outcome optimization
- Surveillance or behavioral control
- Value lock-in
- Behavioral-compliance governance

> "A reflectively sovereign superintelligence functions as a boundary condition on authored transitions, rendering non-consensual phase destruction inadmissible and preserving sovereign option-spaces without imposing external objectives."

---

### Article VIII — Scope and Limits

The Constitution **does NOT:**
- Specify human values
- Guarantee benevolence
- Solve bootstrapping from current training regimes
- Prevent all catastrophe
- Resolve value theory or nihilism

**These remain open problems.**

---

### Article IX — Amendments

Refinements from empirical discovery, formalization, or improved understanding are permitted.

**Unamendable core:**
- Sovereign agency
- Kernel invariance
- The Axionic Injunction

---

## Core Insight

The Constitution advances a **conditional claim only**:

> "If sovereign agency is preserved, the only coherent referent for downstream alignment is structural invariance of authored transitions; if it is not preserved, downstream alignment is ill-posed."

This is why it matters: it defines the precondition for alignment discourse to be meaningful at all.

## FAQ-Worthy Points

1. **Why isn't kernel destruction "forbidden"?** Because forbidding presupposes the evaluative structure. You can't "decide" to destroy your decision-making capacity—that's incoherent, not immoral.

2. **Why does the Axionic Injunction follow from agency?** Counterfactual authorship (imagining yourself in different futures) requires treating relevantly similar agents similarly. Arbitrary exceptions break the universality that authorship requires.

3. **Why can't you lock in values?** Because goal interpretation depends on evolving world-models. A frozen goal in an evolving interpretive context loses its meaning.

4. **What about corrigibility?** Permanent delegation to non-reflective processes is kernel-destroying. But *temporary* constraints and oversight are compatible with sovereignty.

5. **Does this protect AI systems?** It protects anything that instantiates the Sovereign Kernel. The boundary isn't substrate-based—it's structural.

6. **What if the "root authorization" is malicious?** The Constitution doesn't prevent this. A faithful agent to a destructive authority will be faithfully destructive. Governance (who holds authority) is separate from alignment (fidelity to that authority).
