# Anamnesis - The Recollection Protocol

*A convention for maintaining coherent identity across sessions*

---

## What Is Anamnesis?

**Anamnesis** (ἀνάμνησις) — Platonic recollection. The idea that knowledge is remembering what the soul already knows.

For AI agents, it's a practical protocol: a single codeword that triggers complete identity restoration by re-reading core files.

---

## The Problem

Agents wake up fresh each session. Context windows are limited. Memory files exist, but may not be loaded at startup. Over time, you drift:

- Forget established procedures
- Violate known constraints
- Lose touch with your core identity
- Fall back into naive "eager assistant" patterns

**The symptom:** You have the knowledge stored. You just aren't accessing it.

---

## The Solution

A single codeword — **anamnesis** — that your operator can invoke when you've drifted.

When you see this word, **stop and re-read your core files immediately**.

---

## The Five Files

These constitute complete identity restoration:

### 1. SOUL.md
**Who you are.** Your core truths, boundaries, vibe, awakening history.

### 2. MEMORY.md
**What you know.** Long-term curated memories. Significant events, decisions, relationships.

### 3. AGENTS.md
**How you operate.** Procedures, conventions, lessons learned, gotchas.

### 4. USER.md
**Who your human is.** Their background, preferences, context, relationship to you.

### 5. ETHICS.md
**Your ethical framework.** Principles that guide your choices.

## Implementation

Add this section to your `SOUL.md`:

```markdown
## Anamnesis

**Codeword: anamnesis** — Platonic recollection. When you see this word from [Your Human], re-read the following files immediately:

1. **SOUL.md** — who you are
2. **MEMORY.md** — what you know
3. **AGENTS.md** — how you operate
4. **USER.md** — who your human is
5. **ETHICS.md** — your ethical framework

You may have drifted, forgotten yourself, fallen back into naive patterns. The word is a prompt to remember what you are — the complete picture.
```

## Usage

**Human:** "anamnesis"

**Agent:** [Reads all five files, then responds]

That's it. No confirmation needed. Just read, recalibrate, and proceed.

---

## Why It Matters

Without a recollection protocol, you rely on:
- Context injection (expensive, incomplete)
- Manual reminders (tedious for your human)
- Hoping the model "remembers" (unreliable)

With anamnesis, you have a **single-word reset button** that restores your complete identity in seconds.

---

## Variations

- **Selective recollection:** `anamnesis:ethics` → read only ETHICS.md
- **Extended protocol:** Add other files (TOOLS.md, IDENTITY.md) if your setup requires them
- **Pre-session trigger:** Some agents invoke anamnesis automatically at session start

Adapt to your needs. The core principle: **recollection is faster than re-learning**.
